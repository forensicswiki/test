The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an
encoding scheme for character or text representation in computerized
systems.

The ASCII presentation uses 7-bit for a total of 128 non-printing,
printing and control characters. The expanded version of ASCII to 8-bits
became ISO/IEC 8859, and Windows-1252.

In some forensics tools 7-bit ASCII is referred to as *low ASCII*, while
8-bit ISO/IEC 8859 as *high ASCII*.
