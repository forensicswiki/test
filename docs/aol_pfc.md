PFC files are files associated with America Online (AOL). PFC (Personal
Filing Cabinet) is a database file that enables the users to save AOL
emails locally on the computerâ€™s hard drive. It also stores all the
received and sent emails of America Online email client. The PFC file
enables the user to manage and access the AOL mails when the user needs
to work without the presence of internet connectivity. PFC file enables

identify the mails. Each username in AOL has only one PFC file
associated with it, which can be viewed only via AOL. In addition to
this, the PFC file cannot be accessed from any other computer or even if
the user signs as a guest in his own computer.
