There are lots of websites that can provide valuable information for
forensic investigators.

## WHOIS Queries

The WHOIS Service can be used to find the owner of a domain. Sometimes
this is only sufficient to find the registrar for a domain, but even
that is a start.

- [WHOIS-Search.com](https://whois-search.com/)

## Web Page Archives

Web page archives can give the investigator a look at what a web page
used to look like. The most well known is the [Google
cache](http://www.google.com/help/features.html#cached), but here are
some others:

- [The Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](http://web.archive.org) can
  produce a nicely formatted page showing how a website looked on
  certain dates. For example, [the history of yahoo.com's
  homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.yahoo.com/) gives a
  nice history lesson. The machine records both main pages and subpages.
  For example, note the changes in time between [Jesse
  Kornblum](jesse_kornblum.md)'s [Yahoo!
  profile](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.profiles.yahoo.com/jessekornblum).
