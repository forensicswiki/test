Napatech is a leading OEM supplier of multi-port 10 GbE and 1 GbE
intelligent adapters for real-time network analysis with over 40,000
Ethernet ports deployed. Napatech network adapters provide real-time
packet capture and transmission with full line-rate throughput and zero
packet loss no matter the packet size. Intelligent features enable
off-load of data traffic processing and packet analysis normally
performed in the CPU. This results in more processing power for the
network monitoring, analysis, management, test, measurement, security or
optimization application being supported. Napatech has sales, marketing
and R&D offices in Mountain View, California, Andover, Massachusetts,
and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Napatech network adapters can be synchronized with a variety of time
sources, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), IEEE 1588v2, CDMA and
Pulse Per Second (PPS) sources. This allows packets to be time-stamped
with an accuracy of 50 nanoseconds. The time synchronization solution
also allows Napatech adapters to be daisy-chained allowing a single time
synchronization source for multiple adapters.

Napatech intelligent adapters can be used for performance monitoring,
test & measurement, security and optimization markets. The boards
provide interception from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps. Software is available for
Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.
