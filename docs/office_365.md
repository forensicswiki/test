## Audit Trails in Office 365

can be maintained. Performing a mailbox audit logging can help track the
actions executed by mailbox owners, delegates, and administrators on the
target mailbox. The three ways in which auditing can be carried out are:

number of mailboxes and keeping a check on the activities performed on
them whether by delegates, administrators or users.

activated for use. The default settings in auditing are awful and
therefore, the criteria must be specified before starting up with the
investigation.

    a delegate user.
3.  Exchange Admin Center cannot be used for audit logging instead
    remote PowerShell in connection with Exchange online is required.

    number of actions carried out by admin or mailbox delegates are
    automatically logged. Change it.
