**Steganography** is a science that pertains to the art of concealing
data in a communication in such a way that only the sender and receiver
know of its existance and method of access. The platform used for
transmission can be anything from a paper document to a digital file.
Additionally, it is more common than not to
encrypt the hidden data whenever possible such as
with digital files or images. The detection of steganographically
encoded packages is called **[steganalysis](steganalysis.md)**.
