ForensicArtifacts.com Artifact Repository Build Status

A free, community-sourced, machine-readable knowledge base of forensic
artifacts that the world can use both as an information source and
within other tools.

## Terminology

The term artifact (or artefact) is widely used within computer (or
digital) forensics, though there is no official definition of this term.

The definition closest to the meaning of the word within computer
forensics is that of the word artifact within archaeology. The term
should not be confused with the word artifact used within software
development.

If archaeology defines an artifact as:

    something made or given shape by man, such as a tool or
    a work of art, esp an object of archaeological interest

The definition of artifact within computer forensics could be:

    An object of digital archaeological interest.
    Where digital archaeology roughly refers to computer forensics without the forensic (legal) context.

## History

The artifact definitions originate from the [GRR
project](grr.md). It was made into a stand-alone project to
provide more flexibility and allow other projects to make use of the
definitions.
