## Overview

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution, using Unity as the default desktop environment.
It is based on Debian, which is another Linux distribution. Since it is widely
used, many forensic tools function on it. Some teams have built forensic
workstations on top of it.

## Forensic Integration

has many tools preinstalled on it including:

* The Sleuth Kit
* Wireshark
* HexEditor
