Note that the term cyber is arguably misused in the context of "Cyber
Threat Intelligence"
[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet-related_prefixes) and should
be considered more as an equivalent for "Digital Threat Intelligence" or
"Internet Threat Intelligence".

## Terminology

### Indicator

Cyber Threat Indicator: A set of cyber observables combined with
contextual information intended to represent artifacts and/or behaviors
of interest within a cyber security
context.[2](https://msm.mitre.org/docs/STIX-Whitepaper.pdf)

### TTP

TTP, in the context of cyber threat intelligence, is short for Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures also sometimes referred to as Tools,
Techniques, Procedures.

TTPs are representations of the behavior or modus operandi of cyber
adversaries. It is a term taken from the traditional military sphere and
is used to characterize what an adversary does and how they do it in
increasing levels of
detail.[3](https://msm.mitre.org/docs/STIX-Whitepaper.pdf)

Note that the abbreviation TTP is highly ambiguous, e.g. in another
context it can mean Trusted Third Party.

Cons:

- Highly [Mandiant](mandiant.md) product centric standard,
  though seems to have digressed a bit from this since version 1.1
