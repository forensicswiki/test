The **Hypertext Markup Language** (**HTML**) [file format](file_formats.md) is
used to create/display web pages.

Its main purpose is to align text, images, or links on a website in a
specific way. Web pages with **.html** or **.htm** extensions are
examples of static website files. Any server or database technologies
require another language on top of HTML to create dynamic features in a
website. HTML files are mere [plain text files](txt.md) whose
contents follow certain rules.

HTML files are usually viewed using a [web browser](web_browser.md), but can
also be opened with a variety of other programs (i.e., notepad, hex editors,
etc).

HTML can trace its development from SGML as a text-based markup language.

## XHTML

The **Extensive Hypertext Markup Language** (**XHTML**) is similar in
nature to HTML, but has a stricter [XML](xml.md)-based syntax.
