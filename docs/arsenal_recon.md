**About Arsenal Recon**

Arsenal Recon grew out of a need to dig deeper into electronic evidence
than current solutions permitted. Led by the computer forensic experts
at Arsenal Consulting and world-class developers, Arsenal Recon develops
ground-breaking software tools which enable investigators to extract
information from their evidence that other tools simply cannot.

## Software Products

### Arsenal Image Mounter

Arsenal Image Mounter mounts the contents of disk images as complete
disks in Microsoft WindowsÂ®. Arsenal Image Mounter includes a virtual
SCSI adapter (via a unique Storport miniport driver) which allows users
to benefit from disk-specific features in Windows like integration with
Disk Manager, access to Volume Shadow Copies, and more.

### Registry Recon

Registry Recon provides access to an enormous volume of Windows Registry
data which has been effectively deleted, whether that deletion occurred
due to benign system activity, malfeasance by a user, or even re-imaging
by IT personnel.

### Hibernation Recon

Hibernation Recon has been developed to not only support memory
reconstruction from Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1, and 10 hibernation
files, but to properly identify and extract massive volumes of
information from the multiple types (and levels) of slack space that
often exist within them.
