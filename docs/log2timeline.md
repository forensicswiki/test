Log2timeline is designed as a framework for artifact timeline creation
and analysis. The main purpose is to provide a single tool to parse
various log files and artifacts found on suspect systems (and supporting
systems, such as network equipment) and produce a body file that can be
used to create a timeline, using tools such as mactime from TSK, for
forensic investigators.

The tool is written in Perl for Linux but has been tested using Mac OS X
(10.5.7 and 10.5.8). Parts of it should work natively in Windows as well
(with ActiveState Perl installed).

## Description

Log2timeline takes a log file (or a directory) and parses it to produce
a body file that can be imported into other tools for timeline analysis.
The tool has both a modular based approach to the input file as well as
the output file. The default behavior of the current version is to
export the timeline in a body format readable by TSK's (The SleuthKit)
[mactime](http://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Body_file) (although
this can be easily changed). Log2timeline is build as a series of
scripts, this one being the front-end, which uses other scripts to
actually parse the log files (called modules). The tool is build to be
easily extended for anyone that wants to create a new module.

The tool contains (current version of 0.51 nightly build (20102608))
three front-ends:

- **log2timeline** - The main front-end. A tool capable of parsing a
  single log file/directory pointed to the tool using a selected input
  module.
- **timescanner** - A recursive front-end capable of parsing a directory
  passed to the tool and recursively go through each and every file/dir
  and try to parse it with every or selected input modules (to provide
  an automatic method of creating a super timeline).
- **glog2timeline** - A simple GUI front-end, with similar capabilities
  as log2timeline (the main front-end)

## Currently Supported Input Modules

The currently supported input modules (as of version 0.51 nightly build
(20102608)) are:
