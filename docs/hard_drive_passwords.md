Some hard drives support passwords. These passwords can be implemented
in computer's operating system, its BIOS, or even in the hard drive's
firmware. Passwords implemented in the OS are the easiest to remove,
those in the firmware are the hardest.

Sometimes people use the term "password" but the hard drive is really
[encrypted](full_disk_encryption.md), and the password is used
to unlock a decryption key. These passwords cannot be removed â€” the
encryption key must be cracked or discovered through another means.

- Dell will assist law enforcement in removing the passwords from

  this can be done over the phone, once you have a good relationship
  with Dell.
