## On-disk structures

According to
[TECHNET](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737048.aspx):

The location of the database is determined by the partition style of the
disk.

- On MBR disks, the database is contained in the last 1 megabyte (MB) of
  the disk.
- On GPT disks, the database is contained in a 1-MB reserved (hidden)
  partition known as the Logical Disk Manager (LDM) Metadata partition.

## Types of dynamic volumes

- Simple volume
- Spanned volume
- Striped volume
- Mirrored volume (Server editions of Windows 2000, Windows 2003)
