## Overview

**DeepSound** is a Windows specific steganography tool that can hide
data into and also extract data from audio files.

## Description and Review

Similar to hiding data in images, DeepSound allows the user to encode
files into audio files. These audio files can even be burned to a CD
(DeepSound cannot burn the actual CD). Thus files can be hid in an audio
CD and unless it is known to contain data, no one would know to check
it. DeepSound can also reverse this process, and upon opening the
correct track, it will prompt the user for a passphrase. This will then
reveal the concealed data. DeepSound has the ability to use AES 256 bit
encryption.
