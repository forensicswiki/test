**Hachoir** is a generic framework for binary file manipulation. Written
in Python, it's operating system independent and has many text/graphic
user interfaces (ncurses, wxWidget, Gtk+). Although it contains a few
functions to modify files, it is generally intended for examining
existing files. Hachoir currently supports more than sixty file formats.
File format recognition is based on the headers and footers in a disk
image of file. It has a fault tolerant parser designed to handle
truncated or buggy files. The framework also automatically adjusts for
endian or character set issues. The framework can be scripted and
extended.
