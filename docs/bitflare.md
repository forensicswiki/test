**BitFlare** is a Software-as-a-Service offering from SunBlock Systems that
allows non-experts to perform computer forensics, electronic evidence
discovery, and data preservation. The software loads its own operating system
on to a suspect computer, essentially utilizing the suspect machine itself a
forensic platform.

## Capabilities

BitFlare allows users to view and filter visible and deleted file
entries of various common metadata such as timestamps, file names, file
paths, and file sizes. In addition, a user can filter files by supersets
of broad file categories such as Microsoft Office, MRU file links, and
Image and Video files.

Keyword searches can be run across visible and deleted files as well as
across slack, unallocated, and unpartitioned space across the hard
drive. Keyword searching supports full PCRE regular expressions and case
sensitivity.

Relevant files and keyword fragment extraction is facilitated through
Evidence Discovery Packs. Files are saved in their native format.

BitFlare supports hard drive preservation. Users can save encrypted
forensic copies of the hard drive to externally connected devices.
Encrypted images can be sent to SunBlock Systems for decryption, third
party validation, and analysis.

## Sales Model

The BitFlare CD is freely available from the BitFlare website. There is
no upfront licensing cost for BitFlare. Hard drive preservation, file
sorting, and keyword searches are undertaken without cost.

A user must purchase an Evidence Discovery Pack from the BitFlare
website in order to extract files or keyword fragments. Each EDP is
configured by the user, identifying data for extraction on a particular
computer. The BitFlare software executes purchased EDPs, extracting and
documenting relevant evidence.

While hard drive preservation is available without a fee, SunBlock
Systems may charge a fee to unencrypt a forensic copy preserved by
BitFlare.

Computers deemed to have no relevant information incur no cost under
this model.
