Mobile malware is software created to infect or gain access to mobile devices
such as [cell phones](cell_phones.md), tablets, and [PDAs](pdas.md).

## History

Mobile malware was initially considered to be a hoax until it became
obvious that malicious software existed and functioned on mobile
devices. The earliest recorded mobile malware was called Cabir. It was
released in 2004 and was designed to infect
[Symbian](symbian.md) OS platforms via a Bluetooth connection.
It was essentially harmless, but nonetheless proved to the public that
worms could be found on mobile devices.

## Recent Trends

Since mobile devices usually contain private and valuable information,
mobile malware has recently began moving toward having a specific
purpose (usually exploiting information) as opposed to viruses created
solely for bragging rights.

## Attack Types

### Bluetooth

Attacks via Bluetooth have the ability to infect any phone with Bluetooth
capabilities and can even exploit feature phones. These proximity-based attacks
use the local Bluetooth network, usually in a crowded area, to send unwarranted
requests to phones. Since Bluetooth can be used to transmit files, malicious
executables can be sent across the network to everybody that accepts the
request and installs the software. Some of these attacks, such as the Cabir,
are worms which send out the request from an infected phone without the user
knowing, thus quickly spreading it from phone to phone. Protection from these
attacks is simple - cell phone users should not leave Bluetooth on, and it if
is left on, users should not accept requests from unknown connections.

### Application Marketplace

Malicious software can be installed via application marketplaces. For
example, according to webroot.com, applications disguised as Angry Birds
level unlockers were available in the Android Market. Once installed,
the creator had access to precious information such as browsing history,
bookmarks, etc. The application also contacted a remote server that gave
the phone instructions for downloading additional malware.

To protect against this kind of attack, users can judge the legitimacy
of the application with a few simple guidelines. Applications that
require a lot of permissions for no apparent reason should be avoided.
Also, the credibility of a publisher can easily be researched if the
user is unsure.

### Wi-Fi

Information can be stolen from devices when they are connected to public Wi-Fi
hotspots. Users should not do banking, shopping, or other tasks that expose
personal information while connected to unsecured networks. This is not an
issue unique to mobile devices, but because of the nature of mobile devices,
they are more likely to be used in public places on these networks.

### SMS

[SMS](sms.md) attacks are generally similar to each other.
Malicious software is installed on the phone by some means which
continually sends unnoticed text messages from the user's phone to
premium numbers which creates charges on the user's account. According
to Kaspersky Labs, the SMS-Trojan was first discovered for the Android
operating system in early 2011. The news report says, "The Trojan-SMS
category is currently the most widespread class of malware for mobile
phones, but Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a is the first to
specifically target the Android platform." To protect against these
attacks, users should be cautious of what applications are installed on
their devices and who the creators of the applications are.

SMS attacks can also simply be spam messages with links to malicious
sites. The problem with this type of attack is that it must target
specific phones in order to execute scripts that are compatible.

### QR Codes

Because QR Codes are completely obfuscated by nature, they provide the means of
taking curious smartphone users to malicious websites. There are three ways QR
codes can be maliciously presented to a user. The first method is placing a QR
code by itself with no explanation or context, causing some people to get
curious and scan it. The second way of getting people to scan the code is to
place a stamp or sticker over an existing one so that it is disguised as a
harmless QR code. The third way of presenting malicious codes to the public
would be digitally through email.

QR Code attacks work by taking the person that scans it to a website
that performs malicious activities. For example, according to
darkreading.com, a QR code that is distributed to target iOS devices
might navigate the web browser to a site that will jailbreak the phone
and then install malware on it once the built in security can be
altered.

To protect against these attacks, smartphone users should only scan QR
codes with software that allow them to confirm the action the code
elicits.
