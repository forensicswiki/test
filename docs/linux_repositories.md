There are a number of linux distributions.

In general they have primary repositories which are setup for every
installation of the operating system and they have special purpose
repositories which require specific setup.

# Repository Setup

## openSUSE

For current openSUSE 11.4 and 12.1 users it is necessary to have the
following repositories configured:

- security
- devel:languages:perl
- devel:languages:python

This is most easily done from the command line via (assumes openSUSE
12.1):

`sudo zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security/openSUSE_12.1 security`
`sudo zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/perl/openSUSE_12.1 perl`
`sudo zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/openSUSE_12.1 python`

`zypper lr               # used to verify you have the repos installed`

## fedora

[CERT](https://forensics.cert.org/) maintains a fedora security
repository with a large number of DFIR applications.

## debian

You can search for debian packages at [debian's search
page](http://packages.debian.org/search)

## ubuntu

## altlinux

[ALT Linux packages](https://packages.altlinux.org/en/sisyphus/) (interesting things
from autoimports tend to be integrated into main repository)

# Computer Forensic Tools

Below is a list of computer forensic tools. For each tool the repository
it can be found in and the version in the repository is shown.

As an example, aimage is in the openSUSE security repository and it is
version 3.2.5
