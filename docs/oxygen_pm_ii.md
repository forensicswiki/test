### Oxygen Phone Manager II for Symbian OS Smartphones

Oxygen Phone Manager II for Symbian OS smartphones v2.7.6 is an extended
forensic mode of data access which is compatible with Windows and supports a
wide range of phone-connectivity options, including Bluetooth. While users gain
total access to the content of Symbian-powered phones, they leave data
untouched with no noticeable changes.

The program reads the content of a phone and stores it as an image on the hard
drive. This relieves users from running synchronization and ensures faster data
access with more efficient processing. Oxygen Phone Manager II consists of
options to access and edit contacts, calendar items, to-do tasks, messages and
multimedia content. The data can also be exported to other standard
applications, such as MS Outlook and Address Book etc. The image saved to the
hard drive also serves as a backup copy. It protects you against accidental
loss of valuable forensic evidence. It ensures fast migration between phones of
different models and producers. At the same time, Oxygen Phone Manager II
allows a full-scale interactive access to phone content. You can use PC to edit
and send out messages, create or import contacts, access and modify multimedia
content. The program is a go-between that immediately translates content
changes between two operating systems. They can access contacts, calendar,
to-dos and the gallery from a tree of expandable folders. There is a details
panel in the phone browser that shows the file size and other attributes. It
also shows the overall size and number of images, melodies and video clips, and
their drive in which they are present (local, flash card or ROM).

Separate windows show contacts, calendar items and to-dos. The fields
accessible from menus and submenus in Symbian media appear in one grid and are
easy to revise. It has an Outlook-style interface provides access to Unicode
SMS, MMS, e-mail and other messages. It offers many options that you have in an
email service such as file attachment support, a reply with the original
message included, a one-click attachment playback, and others.
