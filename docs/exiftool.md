Exiftool is a Perl library and a command-line tool that can be used for reading
and writing metadata in files. In addition to exif images, Exiftool also
supports many other file formats, such as video and audio files as well as Word
documents. Note that Exiftool does not support writing metadata to some
formats. While Exiftool can be helpful in a forensic analysis, it is not a
forensic tool, nor is it an anti-forensic tool.

# License

Exiftool is free and open source release under the same terms as Perl.

# Supported Files

The exiftool [website](https://exiftool.org/#supported) has a comprehensive
list of the supported file types, and indicates if Exiftool supports reading,
writing, and/or creating metadata for each file type. Exiftool's specialty is
image file formats. It can extract exif and gps metadata and it can extract
Maker Notes from several popular manufacturers.
