A Universally Unique Identifier, sometimes also called a Globally Unique
IDentifier, is a number generated such that it is guaranteed to be
unique in space and time. They are normally 128 bit numbers, although
some of those bits are used to define a version of the UUID. The UUID
specification is given in [RFC
4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).

## Usage

UUIDs are in many modern applications. For example, they are used as
identifiers in the Windows Registry and as part of the Message ID field
for [Apple Mail emails](apple_mail_header_format.md).
