Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and
extracted named entities such as People, Places, Things and Time from
natural language documents.

Named Entity Recognition is a growing part of computer forensics. Please
see [Wikipedia's article on Named entity
recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_entity_recognition) for
complete information. The remainder of this article stresses aspects of
NER that are relevant to current forensics practice and research.
