**SHA-1** (**S**ecure **H**ash **A**lgorithm) is a cryptographic hash
function that was first published in 1995 in Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) PUB 180-1 by the National Security Agency
(NSA) as a fix to an unknown flaw found in SHA-0.

In February of 2005 an attack was announced that could find collisions
in SHA-1 requiring fewer than 2<sup>69</sup> operations.

## Tools

On most Unix systems the tool sha1sum can be used to compute the SHA-1
hash of a file or devices.
