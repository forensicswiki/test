From Wikipedia: The **Background Debug Mode interface** (BDM) is an
electronic interface that allows debugging of embedded systems. Specifically,
it provides in-circuit debugging functionality in microcontrollers. It requires
a single wire and specialized electronics in the system begin debugged.

Background Debug Mode might be an interesting venue for forensic
research on embedded systems.
