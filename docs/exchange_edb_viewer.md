*Exchange EDB Viewer* is a freeware standalone tool which can scan and
offer preview of database file without Server environment needed.

## Features

upgradable freeware tool. Further, in case of a severely damaged
Exchange database, advanced mode of scanning can be opted. A number of
features will be added to the tool on upgrading it to a licensed
