**Microsoft Pocket PC**, sometimes referred to as P/PC or PPC, is based
upon the Windows CE framework. Variants of this operating system include
versions such as Pocket PC 2000, Pocket PC 2002, Windows Mobile
2003/2003 SE, 5 and Windows Mobile 6.0. Variants also exist for
[Smartphones](smartphones.md), such as Windows Mobile 2003
Smartphone edition.

## Benefits

One of the key benefits of Microsoft's Windows Mobile platform is file format
compatibility with the desktop versions of the company's productivity software.
Mobile versions of Microsoft software, such as Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, and
Pocket PowerPoint, allow individuals to view and edit these files outside of
the home and office.

Another benefit is integration with Microsoft's cross-platform solution,
the .NET Framework. The .NET Framework and its associated class
libraries handle things such as memory management, file I/O, and many
other functions. The .NET Framework allows programmers to develop code
in one of several .NET languages, such as C# and VB.NET. Pocket PCs run
a simplified version of the framework called the .NET Compact Framework.

In order to maintain synchronization and connectivity with desktop
computers, Microsft developed the ActiveSync program. The user merely
has to connect the Pocket PC to the desktop computer in order to
synchronize items such as appointments, contact lists, and even
multimedia files.

## History

Windows CE, which serves as the framework for the Pocket PC operating
systems, began its life in November of 1996. The NEC MobilePro 200 and
the Casio A-10 were the first two PDA-type devices available with this
early version of the operating system, which was dubbed Handheld PC 1.0.

Subsequently, Microsoft released iterations of its mobile operating
systems with names such as Handheld PC 2.0 (1997), Palm-Size PC 2.0
(1998), Handheld PC Professional Edition (1998).

As development of Windows CE continued, manufacturers began to build
more esoteric devices around it, such as internet TV set-top boxes and
web-enabled telephones.

Pocket PC officially began its public life when it was previewed at the
Consumer Electronics Show in 2000. Codenamed "Rapier", the first version
of the Pocket PC operating system was simply named Pocket PC.

## Pocket PC Versions

### Pocket PC 2000

Pocket PC 2000, based on Micrsoft's Windows CE 3.0 platform, was a first
step towards the familiar appearance and functionality that is offered
by Windows Mobile 5.0. Devices running Pocket PC 2000 ranged from the
Askey PC010, which had a 16-color grayscale screen with no expansion
slots, to the Casio EM-500, which had a 64k color screen and provisions
for upgraded pheripherals such as cameras. Pocket PC 2000 launched with
versions of Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, and Microsoft Reader bundled.
ActiveSync 3.1, which provided an easier way to install applications
onto the Pocket PC, was required to synchronize with host desktop
machines.

### Pocket PC 2002

Codenamed "Merlin," Pocket PC 2002 was Microsoft's Windows CE 3.0-based
upgrade to Pocket PC 200. Pocket PC 2002 offered many improvements over
the previous operating system, including a Terminal Service Client, a
new mail Inbox, Windows Media Player 8.0, improved versions of Pocket
Word and MS Reader, and many other features.

There were three service packs (EUUU1/2/3) released which addressed bugs
and other issues in the original release.

## Pocket PC Devices

In recent years, a number of manufacturers have elected to produce
Pocket PC devices. Some of these makers include companies such as:

* Acer
* Asus
* Audiovox
* Dell
* HP
* HTC
* Mitac
* Motorola
* MWg
* Samsung
* Siemens
* Sony Ericsson
* Symbol
* Treo

Because different manufacturers are targeted at different segments of
the market, such as business and consumers, the features and
functionality of these devices sometimes differ greatly. For example,
some devices have built-in capability for taking images and videos,
while other devices have tools such as biometric fingerprint readers and
barcode scanners.
