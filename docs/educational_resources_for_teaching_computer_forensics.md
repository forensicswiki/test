## Realistic Cases

One of the most difficult things for new investigators is finding sample
cases to work on.

- The <http://digitalcorpora.org/> website has more than 5 terabytes of
  realistic computer forensics data, including disk images, memory
  dumps, and packet captures. Also available are instructor's packets
  and answer keys.

- The [HoneyNet Project](http://honeynet.org/) has several [forensics
  challenges](http://honeynet.org/misc/chall.html) online. These include
  the "Scan of Month", "The Reverse Challenge," and "The Forensic
  Challenge." The last one asked entrants to examine a complete RedHat
  Linux system for information. All of these challenges include complete
  solutions.
