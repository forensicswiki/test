The **Advanced Audio Coding** (**AAC**) file format is a lossy digital audio
encoding format. Files downloaded from the iTunes Music Store are available in
this format.

## Metadata

AAC files usually have a file ending of .m4p and
contain lots of [metadata](metadata.md). The output of the
[Unix](unix.md) [strings](strings.md) command suggests
that at least the following information is contained:

- Name of the person who downloaded the file from the iTunes Music Store
- Email address of that person (sometimes)
- Timestamp of when the file was downloaded
- Another timestamp (probably the date when the file was put into the
  iTunes Music Store?)
- The usual metadata of music files (artist, album, cover art etc.)
