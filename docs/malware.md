trojans, worms, and botnets to the affected device. It is illegal to
knowingly distribute malware.

Often utilizing a drive-by-download.

## Rootkit

A rootkit is a stealthy type of software, typically malicious, designed
to hide the existence of certain processes or programs from normal
methods of detection and enable continued privileged access to an
operating system.

Various types of rootkits:

* User mode
* Kernel mode
  * Bootkits
* Hypervisor level
* Firmware and Hardware
