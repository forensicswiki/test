The **Forensic Toolkit** (**FTK**) is a commercial forensic software
package distributed by [AccessData](accessdata.md).

# Features

The Forensic toolkit can parse a number of filesystems, including [FAT](fat.md)
12/16/32, [NTFS](ntfs.md), NTFS Compressed, [ext2 and ext3](extended_file_system_(ext).md).
It can use image files created by [AFF](aff.md), [EnCase](encase.md),
[SMART](smart.md), Snapback, some versions of
[Safeback](safeback.md) and [dd](dd.md).

The program allows users to search with keywords or take advantage of drive
indexing using the [dtSearch](dtsearch.md) algorithm.

## Data Reduction

The Known File Filter, or KFF, can be used to eliminate or highlight
known files using [MD5](md5.md) hashes generated by user or from
[NIST](national_software_reference_library.md) or
[Hashkeeper](hashkeeper.md).
