# Introduction

Developed by ASR Data, the Expert Witness file format (aka E01 format
aka EnCase file format) is an industry standard format for storing
"forensic" images. The format allows a user to access arbitrary offsets
in the uncompressed data without requiring decompression of the entire
data stream. The specification does <b>NOT</b> provide for quantifyable
assurance of integrity, it is up to the implementation to provide
meaningful authentication for <b>any</b> data contained in an "evidence
file".

# Overview

The Expert Witness Compression format can store a single image in one or
more segment files. Each file consists of a standard 13-byte header,
followed by a series of sections. The sections are typically arranged
back-to-back. A section cannot span two files.

A <i>Chunk</i> is a 32k run of data (64 standard sectors). All offsets
are relative to the beginning of the segment file, unless otherwise
noted.

File Header Each file begins with the following 13-byte header. (This is
not to be confused with the header section, below.)

<i>Signature Part (8 bytes)...</i>

|       |       |      |      |      |      |      |
|:------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Bytes | 3     | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| Data  | "EVF" | 0x09 | 0x0d | 0x0a | 0xff | 0x00 |

<i>Fields Part (5 bytes)...</i>

|         |      |                |        |
|:--------|------|----------------|--------|
| Bytes   | 1    | 2              | 2      |
| Data    | 0x01 | 1 or higher    | 0x0000 |
| Meaning |      | Segment Number |        |

# The Section

Every <i>section</i> begins with the same standard data, with the
following layout.

|           |        |                          |                                                   |
|:----------|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Offset:   | Bytes: | Data:                    | Meaning:                                          |
| 0 (0x0)   | 16     | "volume", "header", etc. | Section type string                               |
| 16 (0x10) | 8      |                          | 64-bit offset in current file to the next section |
| 24 (0x18) | 8      |                          | 64-bit byte-size of the section                   |
| 32 (0x20) | 40     | 0x00...                  | Padding                                           |
| 72 (0x48) | 4      |                          | CRC of all previous setion data                   |

# Section Types

Expert Witness Compression uses the following section types: `header`,
`volume`, `table`, `next`, and `done`. Some of these section types have
unique data that begins directly after the standard section structure
above.

## 'header' section...

|           |                   |                         |                                |
|:----------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Offset:   | Bytes:            | Data:                   | Meaning:                       |
| 76 (0x4c) | to end of section | zlib compress()'ed data | Comments structure (see below) |

<i>Comment structure is simply a text string in the following tab- and
newline-delimited format. (The data in each cell is separated by a tab
character, and each row is separated by a newline character.) The first
three lines are standard and must not change. The characters in the
third line serve as reminders for the content of the fields in the
fourth line. (The fourth line is the only line that needs to be
customized.)</i>

|             |
|:------------|
| 1           |
| main        |
| c           |
| Case Number |

- <i>Case Number, Evidence Number, Unique Description, Examiner Name,
  and Notes are free-form (provided they don't contain tab or newline
  characters).</i>
- <i>Acquired Date and System Date are in the form of: "2002 3 4 10 19
  59" (March 4, 2002 10:19:59).</i>
- <i>pwhash should simply be the character '0'.</i>
- <i>char should be the one of these three characters: 'b', 'f', or 'n'.
  This represents "best", "fastest", or "no compression". Expert Witness
  Compression uses 'f'.</i>

The header section should appear in the first segment file only.

## 'volume' section...

|            |        |         |                                                            |
|:-----------|--------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Offset:    | Bytes: | Data:   | Meaning:                                                   |
| 76 (0x4c)  | 4      | 1       | Reserved                                                   |
| 80 (0x50)  | 4      |         | Chunk Count                                                |
| 84 (0x54)  | 4      | 64      | Sectors per Chunk                                          |
| 88 (0x58)  | 4      | 512     | Bytes per Sector                                           |
| 92 (0x5c)  | 4      |         | Sector Count                                               |
| 96 (0x60)  | 20     | 0x00... | Reserved                                                   |
| 116 (0x74) | 45     | 0x00... | Padding                                                    |
| 161 (0xa1) | 5      |         | Reserved (Signature)                                       |
| 166 (0xa6) | 4      |         | CRC of all previous 'volume' data, starting with offset 76 |

The volume section should appear in the first segment file only.

## 'table' section...

|                          |                      |         |                                                           |
|:-------------------------|----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Offset:                  | Bytes:               | Data:   | Meaning:                                                  |
| 76 (0x4c)                | 4                    | 1       | Chunk Count (for this table)                              |
| 80 (0x50)                | 16                   | 0x00... | Padding                                                   |
| 96 (0x60)                | 4                    |         | CRC of all previous 'table' data, starting with offset 76 |
| 100 (0x64)               | as long as necessary |         | Offset array (see below)                                  |
| from end of offset array | to end of section    |         | zlib compress()'ed data Chunks                            |

<i>The offset array is a series of back-to-back 4-byte unsigned integer
values. Each entry is an offset to the start of a compressed 'Chunk'.
The high bit of each value must be set! There must be one entry per
Chunk.</i>

Each table section can hold 16375 entries. If more entries are needed,
you must create multiple table sections per file.

## 'next' and 'done' sections...

Each file ends with a 'next' or 'done' section. If the file is the last
segment in an Expert Witness compressed image, the section will be named
'done'. Otherwise, the section will be named 'next' to indicate that
another segment file must be read. The "next section" pointer for these
section types points to the beginning of the section itself, since it is
the last section in a file. These section types have no unique data.
