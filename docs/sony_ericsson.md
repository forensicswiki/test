**Sony Ericsson** is a joint venture established in 2001 by the Japanese
consumer electronics company Sony Corporation and the Swedish
telecommunications company Ericsson to make mobile phones. The stated
reason for this venture is to combine Sony's consumer electronics
expertise with Ericsson's technological leadership in the communications
sector. Both companies have stopped making their own mobile phones.
