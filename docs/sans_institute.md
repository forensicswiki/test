[SANS Institute](sans_institute.md) was established in 1989 as a
cooperative research and education organization. Its programs now reach
more than 165,000 security professionals around the world. A range of
individuals from auditors and network administrators, to chief
information security officers are sharing the lessons they learn and are
jointly finding solutions to the challenges they face. At the heart of
SANS are the many security practitioners in varied global organizations
from corporations to universities working together to help the entire
information security community. SANS is the most trusted and by far the
largest source for information security training and security
certification in the world. It also develops, maintains, and makes
available at no cost, the largest collection of research documents about
various aspects of information security, and it operates the Internet's
early warning system - the Internet Storm Center.
