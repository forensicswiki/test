A [Linux](linux.md) [Live CD](Live_CD "wikilink") intended for penetration
testing.

[Matriux](matriux.md) is a fully featured security distribution,
based on [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md). It consists of powerful, free and
open source computer forensics and data recovery tools which can be used
for forensics analysis and investigation purposes.

Apart from forensics usages Matriux also provides a wide platform to let
security professionals utilize the power of open source to perform
day-to-day web application penetration testing and server hardening
tasks.

Matriux is lite and designed to run from a CD / DVD or USB stick or it
can easily be installed to your hard disk in a few steps in no time.

## History

An Indian infosec professional [*Manu
Zacharia*](http://manuzacharia.blogspot.com/) had initialized the idea
of developing Matriux as a security distribution in 2008 and by the end
of 2009 on 5th December released the Matriux **Lithium** version at
[ClubHack2009](http://clubhack.com/2009/) Its successor Matriux
**Xenon** was released on December 4, 2010 at
[ClubHack2010](http://clubhack.com/2010/)

Matriux is also Asia's first OS for hacking, penetration testing, and
cyber forensic investigation.
