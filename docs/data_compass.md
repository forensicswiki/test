**Data Compass** is a hardware and software data recovery tool produced
by [SalvationDATA](salvationdata.md). The product uses a "3+1
Data Recovery" to restore damaged media. The product is intended to
recover data from hard drives with multiple bad sectors, platter surface
problems, head instabilities, or are making clicking sounds. The vendor
claims to spin up hard drives using an emulated
[firmware](firmware.md) rather than the drive's own firmware.
This could enable recovery from damaged hardware, but this claim has not
been independently verified. A software component is available for
filesystem repair.
