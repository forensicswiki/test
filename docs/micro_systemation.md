Micro Systemation (MSAB) is a public company based in Stockholm, Sweden
who specialize in producing a mobile forensics product called XRY.

The company which was founded in 1984 has a long history of involvement
in mobile communications and their first product SoftGSM was designed to
help early mobile phones uers connect to their computers to back up
important information.

In 2002 work with the Swedish Police led to the identification of a need
for forensic software which could assist law enforcement to recover data
from mobile phones and in 2003 XRY was created. Originally called .XRY
after the unique file extension the reports create, the product is now
generally referred to and branded as XRY.

The companies early success was in promoting the product to law
enforcement agencies in Western Europe who were early adopters of the
product. The company now has offices in Europe and the USA, as well as a
network of distributors globally.

XRY is used by Police, Law Enforcement, Military, Government
Intelligence Agencies and Forensic Laboratories in over 60 countries. In
May 2011 they supplied over 95% of Police Forces in the United Kingdom
with XRY.

The company is listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange.
