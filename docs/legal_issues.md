# The Hacker Defense (aka Trojan/Virus Defense)

Below are accounts of different hacker/virus/Trojan related defenses.
Albeit some of these are not ‘reputable’ web sources, but they should
all have official court backing from wherever the various investigators
that do similar. The Crown Prosecution Service (covers England and
Wales) is training prosecutors en masse about ‘trojan defenses’ (link
below). These types of actions would not occur unwarranted. Why do all
the extra work for nothing?

“The "Trojan defense" has now become standard in many types of computer
crime cases. But the defense often plays on the ignorance of juries and
prosecutors. It has raised the need for the CPS to do more to explain
complex technical issues in simple terms to judges and juries, says
George.” (Esther George is the policy adviser at the Crown Protection
Services)

sites and uploading child porn images. Guilty charge upheld.

Odd spin on the issue, where a hacker used a Trojan to gain access to
potential pedophile’s computers.

downloaded the child pornography to Bandy’s computer without his
knowledge.

computer.

## Connecticut v. Amero

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_v._Amero):

The defendant in the case, Julie Amero (born 1967), a substitute
teacher, was previously convicted of four counts of risk of injury to a
minor, or impairing the morals of a child, as the result of a computer
that was infected with spyware and DNS hijacking software; the
conviction was vacated on appeal.
