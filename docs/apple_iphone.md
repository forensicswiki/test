The **iPhone** is a smartphone made by [Apple Inc.](apple_inc.md) and sold
with service through AT&T. It can be used to send/receive email
(see [IPhone Mail Header Format](iphone_mail_header_format.md), keep schedules,
surf the web, and view videos from YouTube. A large number of forensic products
can process iPhones, see Tools section.

In December 2009, Nicolas Seriot presented a paper
[1](http://seriot.ch/resources/talks_papers/iPhonePrivacy.pdf) in
combination with a harvesting application named
[SpyPhone](https://github.com/nst/spyphone). This application grabs data
as sensitive as location data and a cache of keyboard words. It neither
requires jailbreaking nor makes Private API calls (which Apple's App
Store does not allow in any application it distributes).

## Tools

* [Belkasoft Evidence Center](https://belkasoft.com/x)
  by [Belkasoft](belkasoft.md) can make iPhone logical acquisition and analyze
  iOS backups and dumps.
* Cellebrite BlackBag Technology Mobilyze
* [Cellebrite UFED](https://www.cellebrite.com/forensic-solutions/ios-forensics.html)
