The **iPhone** is a smartphone made by [Apple Inc.](apple_inc..md) and sold
with service through AT&T. It can be used to send/receive [email](email.md)
(see [IPhone Mail Header Format](iphone_mail_header_format.md), keep schedules,
surf the web, and view videos from YouTube. A large number of forensic products
can process iPhones, see Tools section.

In December 2009, Nicolas Seriot presented a paper
[1](http://seriot.ch/resources/talks_papers/iPhonePrivacy.pdf) in
combination with a harvesting application named
[SpyPhone](https://github.com/nst/spyphone). This application grabs data
as sensitive as location data and a cache of keyboard words. It neither
requires jailbreaking nor makes Private API calls (which Apple's App
Store does not allow in any application it distributes).
