# Mandiant

Mandiant is a US-based cybersecurity company that was acquired by Google Cloud
in 2022. Mandiant was originally founded as Red Cliff Consulting in 2004 before
rebranding in 2006. Mandiant gained significant fame in February 2013 when it
released the [APT1 report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/reports/apt1-exposing-one-chinas-cyber-espionage-units),
a report detailing and implicating China's efforts, specifically China's 2nd
Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD)
3rd Department (Military Cover Designator 61398), in cyber espionage.

In December 2013, Mandiant was acquired by FireEye, and the combined company
offered incident response, consulting, and proactive services, managed
detection and response (MDR), and various cybersecurity products. The FireEye
name and product line were sold to Symphony Technology Group in June 2021.

In March 2022, Google announced its plans to acquire Mandiant and integrate it
in Google Cloud. The acquisition was completed in September 2022. The Mandiant
brand will be retained as a part of Google Cloud.

Since its inception, Mandiant has significant contributions to the DFIR
community, including (but not limited to):

* Discovery and release of new forensic artifacts.
* Disclosure of threat intelligence reports and threat actor TTPs.
* Release and maintenance of free, open or closed source tools.
