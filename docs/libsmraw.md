The **libsmraw** package contains a library and applications to read and

## History

Libsmraw was created by [Joachim Metz](joachim_metz.md) in 2010,
while working for Hoffmann Investigations.
Libsmraw is a rewrite of earlier work for the proof-of-concept
multi-threaded imager: GNOME Forensic Imager.
