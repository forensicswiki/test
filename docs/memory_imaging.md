Memory imaging is the process of making a bit-by-bit copy of memory. In
principle it is similar to [Disk Imaging](disk_imaging.md).

For physical memory it is common to have sections that are not
accessible, e.g. because of memory-mapped I/O

The resulting copy is stored in a Forensics image format. Some of these formats
have means to differentiate between an image of memory and e.g. that of a disk.

## Introduction

The [physical memory](physical_memory.md) of computers can be imaged and
analyzed using a variety of tools. Because the procedure for accessing physical
memory varies between operating systems, these tools are listed by operating
system. Once memory has been imaged, it is subjected to [memory analysis](memory_analysis.md)
to ascertain the state of the system, extract artifacts, and so on.

One of the most vexing problems for memory imaging is verifying that the
image has been created correctly. That is, verifying that it reflects
the actual contents of memory at the time of its creation. Because the
contents of memory are constantly changing on a running system, the
process can be repeated but the results will never--to a high degree of
probability--be the same. Thus, repeating the acquisition and comparing
the results is not a feasible means of validating correct image
creation. [Memory analysis](memory_analysis.md) can reveal
whether the image's contents are consistent with the known layout and
structure of a given operating system, as well as answering other
questions, but it cannot answer the question as to whether the image
accurately reflects the system from which it was taken at the time it
was taken.

## Methods

### Reading from the Physical Memory Object

In [Windows](windows.md) the Physical Memory Object,
\\\Device\PhysicalMemory, can be used the access physical memory. Since
Windows 2003 SP1 user-mode access to this device-object is no longer
permitted.

A kernel-mode process is still allowed to read from this device-object.

### MmMapIoSpace

The MmMapIoSpace function (or routine) is kernel-mode function to map a
physical address range to non-paged system space.

## Memory Imaging Techniques

Crash Dumps
When configured to create a full memory dump,
[Windows](windows.md) operating systems will automatically save
an image of physical memory when a bugcheck (aka blue screen or kernel
panic) occurs. Andreas Schuster has a
[blog post](http://computer.forensikblog.de/en/2005/10/acquisition_2_crashdump.html)
describing this technique.

LiveKd Dumps
The Sysinternals tool LiveKd can be used to create an image of physical memory
on a live machine in crash dump format. Once livekd is started, use the command
".dump -f \[output file\]"

Hibernation Files
[Windows](windows.md) 98, 2000, XP, 2003, and Vista support a
feature called hibernation that saves the
machine's state to the disk when the computer is powered off. When the
machine is turned on again, the state is restored and the user can
return to the exact point where they left off. The machine's state,
including a compressed image of [physical
memory](physical_memory.md), is written to the disk on the
system drive, usually C:, as [hiberfil.sys](hiberfil.sys.md).
This file can be parsed and decompressed to obtain the memory image.
Once [hiberfil.sys](hiberfil.sys.md) has been obtained,
Sandman can be used to convert it to a dd image.

[Mac OS X](mac_os_x.md) very kindly creates a file called
**/var/vm/sleepimage** on any laptop that is suspended. This file is NOT
erased when the machine starts up. It is unencrypted even if the user
turns on [File Vault](file_vault.md) and enables Secure Virtual
Memory.

Firewire
It is possible for [Firewire](firewire.md) or IEEE1394 devices
to directly access the memory of a computer. Using this capability has
been suggested as a method for acquiring memory images for forensic
analysis. Unfortunately, the method is not safe enough to be widely used
yet. There are some published papers and tools, listed below, but they
are not yet forensically sound. These tools do not work with all
Firewire controllers and on other can cause system crashes. The
technology holds promise for future development, in general should be
avoided for now.

At CanSec West 05, Michael Becher, Maximillian Dornseif, and Christian N.
Klein discussed an exploit which uses Direct Memory Access (DMA) to read
arbitrary memory locations of a [firewire](firewire.md)-enabled system. The
[paper](https://simson.net/ref/2005/2005-firewire-cansecwest.pdf)
lists more details. The exploit is run on an [iPod running Linux](http://www.ipodlinux.org/).
This can be used to grab screen contents.

This technique has been turned into a tool.

The [Goldfish](http://digitalfire.ucd.ie/?page_id=430) tool automates
this exploit for investigators needing to analyze the memory of a Mac.

Cold and Warm reboots
Typical RAM-modules retain memory during reboots as long as power is
provided. The modules typically support a self-refresh. Whether the data
is retained depend on BIOS-es that do or do not clear the RAM during
their initialisation of the motherboards. Warm reboots refer to reboot
methods in which power is never removed from the memory module. Tools
like
[msramdump](https://github.com/dbrant/msramdmp)
or
[afterlife](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/digitalintelligence/tools/afterlife/)
act like minimal OS-es with a memory footprint around a few 100k that
can save memory to disk (Nowadays often only upto 4G afaik). When the
RAM is cleared by the standard BIOS, replacing the BIOS
can be an option. Depending on the motherboard this method works fine.
[Cold boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack) refers to the
cooling of RAM te increase the time the RAM module will retain data
without power. Opinions on how practical cold boot is are discussed in
"[On the Practicability of Cold Boot
Attacks](https://faui1-files.cs.fau.de/filepool/projects/coldboot/fares_coldboot.pdf)".

Virtual Machine Imaging
There are numerous popular virtual machines that are in wide use such as
xen, qemu or vmware. If the memory image is for a machine running in
this kind of virtual environment, there are usually two methods for
obtaining a memory image. The common method is to pause/suspend/stop the
system and then collect the resulting memory image file, this has the
disadvantage of taking the machine offline during the suspend time.
Alternatively most of these systems support live dumping of a memory
image. [Qemu](http://www.qemu.org) supports the pmemsave function,
[Xen](https://xenproject.org/) has the xm dump-core command.
