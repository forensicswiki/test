<strong>[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com)</strong> is a
complete suite of forensics and analysis tools in one cohesive software
package from <strong>[SubRosaSoft
Inc.](http://www.SubRosaSoft.com)</strong>

# Summary

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) combines the power of
many individual functions into one application in order to provide a
single solution for law enforcement professionals and digital forensic
investigators.

Detailed documentation is automatically created while you are performing
your forensic examination. Logs are kept of every action performed,
every item found, and freeform notes taken during the case, to tie them
all together with your thoughts on the process. These can then be
exported in a standardized, customizable, easy-to-share,
template-driven, HTML report either at the end of, or during the
investigation. Click here for a sample output report.

Evidentiary integrity is maintained and protected with the utmost care.
Duplicates are made at top speed (perfect for time sensitive acquisition
tasks) with careful consideration for protecting the original media.
Backups are made with integrated segmenting, granular hashing, and
intelligent media fault management. Inline processing allows the
creation of dual output images and associated hash files.

Keyword analysis and cataloging is performed in multiple languages and
includes [MD5](md5.md), [SHA1](sha1.md) and
[SHA256](sha256.md) checksum calculations. This allows the
investigator to seek out items of interest across entire devices, within
folders of files, directly inside specific files.

Data recovery allows forensics professionals to find and recover deleted
files and those also embedded - then preview those files within
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com). Even swap space and
unallocated space can be explored for evidence.

# Features

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) combines the power of
many individual functions into one application in order to provide a
single solution for law enforcement professionals and digital forensic
investigators.

## Main Window

The main window provides the investigator with a detailed view of the
file system and any devices that are attached to the computer. It is
from the ‘Main Window’ that the digital forensic investigator can
explore the suspect device, drive or media and gain quick access to the
core functions of [MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com):

- Case Manager Window


For handling the details of each specific case.

- Logs Window


For access to the individuals steps, processes, actions, notes and
bookmarks of the case.

- Acquire Window


For creating open standard disk images of suspect devices, drives or
media and securing evidential integrity.

- Catalog Window


For creating catalog lists and bookmarking suspect files and data.

- Analyze Window


For analyzing data on a block-by-block basis in [HEX](hex.md) or
[ASCII](ascii.md) mode, as well as for reviewing data in native
mode and search through block data using custom multilingual pattern
matching.

- Salvage Window


For rescuing, recovering, undeleting, and even salvaging files that
exist in the directory catalog or have in fact been deleted or erased.
After an initial scan files can also be previewed, prior to recovery.

- Browse Window


For previewing and bookmarking evidence within a directory structure.

- Notepad & Case Notes


For making notes pertaining to the case on a per need basis.

- Attaching and Detaching Disk Images


[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) can handle both
physical media and image files of a wide range.

## Case Logs Window

Detailed logs are kept of every step, action and points of interest
during a forensics investigation to support the evidential case, as and
when required, whether in understanding or presenting the digital
forensic evidence.

The "Logs Window" provides the investigator with access to comprehensive
details of the case. Actions are logged in detail and time-stamped, as
are case notes submitted during the course of the investigation.

The logs viewer provides the investigator with access to such logs as:

- <strong>Chronology log</strong> - detailing every action taken during
  the investigation (step-by-step)
- <strong>Bookmarks log</strong> - providing access to each and every
  bookmarked file
- <strong>Acquisition log</strong> - detailing every acquisition and
  details thereof
- <strong>Catalog log</strong> - for retaining cataloged file items for
  further reference
- <strong>Analysis log</strong> - contains a step-by-step reference
  forensics analysis during the case
- <strong>Salvage log</strong> - provides notes on and access to the
  salvaged files
- <strong>Notes log</strong> - retains all the notes posted during the
  course of an investigation

During the course of, or at the end of, the investigation, the forensics
investigator can choose to export the log data into a standardized HTML
report for sharing within a department or externally, via the web or
otherwise. The reports can be viewed on any computer in any web browser
and make the sharing of case files and details extremely simple,
essentially encapsulating the procedure in a 2 step process.

## Forensics Acquisition Window

The acquisition process allows the forensics investigator to replicate
and secure evidence from suspect devices, drives or media in the form of
disk images for further analysis rather than working on the suspect
device, drive or media itself; thus ensuring evidential integrity.

Whether the suspect device, drive or media is sound or faulty, the
investigator can make the necessary backup and working copies as
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) uses a proprietary,
fault tolerant technology to work around a wide range of errors to
create disk images.

Should the device under forensic investigation encounter problems during
the acquisition process, such that the disk image cannot be made in a
single pass, the investigator can simply quit and then use the
acquisition resume feature to start the process again after restarting
the device.

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) works on faulty
drives with bad blocks, corrupted information, or intermittent errors in
read/write, so that the forensics investigator can create a good working
disk image of the suspect drive, drive or media.

Other features of the "Acquire" window include, but are not limited to:

- Disk images created using the acquisition process with
  [MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) are saved in an
  open ISO standard and can be read and opened by many standard
  applications.

<!-- -->

- Segmentation of an acquisition for storage of the data across multiple
  backup sources, such as DVD-R's.

<!-- -->

- The ability to make a separate "Golden Master" image at the same time.

<!-- -->

- Real time data checks using [MD5](md5.md),
  [SHA1](sha1.md), [SHA256](sha256.md) checksums and the
  ability for the investigator to assign at what intervals
  [MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) must perform a
  checksum validation.

<!-- -->

- Automatic block matching for damaged media such as scratched data CDs
  or physically damaged hard drives

## Data Cataloging Window

Automatic analysis of all files in a directory structure, the cataloging
process searches through the directory structure in order to catalog all
files as well as to zero in on suspect material.
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) can create a list of
all files within a directory structure including all catalog
information, [MD5](md5.md), [SHA1](sha1.md), and
[SHA256](sha256.md) checksums, and basic file information.

In order to zero in on areas of particular interest Positive and
Negative filters can be applied using custom checksum databases or those
provided by the National Software Reference Library. The cataloged
information can be customized for any particular requirement, the
forensics investigator can also auto-bookmark catalogued items for
future reference and just as easily predefine the data that is entered
into the catalog log during the procedure at the click of a button.

## Forensics Analysis Window

The analysis window is for manual analysis of data, block-by-block. The
"Analyze" function allows the digital forensic investigator to explore
the data of a file or device in both [ASCII](ascii.md),
[HEX](hex.md) and native views, providing access both to the
source as well as the actual content of the file overall. Whether
looking at the headers of the file in [ASCII](ascii.md) mode or
reviewing the content of an image, sound file or movie in native mode,
"Analyze" can handle the task.

"Analyze" also provides a search feature which allows quick searching
for keywords and other strings, created either on an ad hoc basis or
imported as a custom database, and the analysis window provides the
investigator with 2 means by which to do this:

- Block-by-block and page-by-page, or
- With [HEX](hex.md) and [ASCII](ascii.md) search terms.

And once the analysis and search procedures are complete, the forensics
investigator can then hash and/or export the analysis data to a file, or
files, for further reference and safekeeping. The investigator can now,
in version 1.5, also easily bookmark analysis data, assigning it to a
category as he or she does so.

## File Salvage & Data Recovery Window

[MacForensicsLab™'s](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) Salvage function
will search a device, volume, or folder and list all the recoverable
files. The displayed files can then be recovered to a destination
folder.

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) has an option to skip
all used space when scanning a Mac OS Extended (HFS Plus) volume, thus
improving the speed of the recovery and addressing only the files that
have been deleted.

When salvaging a device,
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) scans through the
entire media to recover as many files as possible from the drive or
media. Recovering in device mode is useful when the drive refuses to
mount or if the volume’s directory information is corrupted.
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) can also locate files
within files (such as caches, email attachments, and archives).

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) can also work with
disk images from various sources. It supports standard ISO disk images,
as well as [EnCase](encase.md), UNIX
dd, Drive Genius™, and [SubRosaSoft
CopyCatX™.](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=7)

## Other Features

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) contains many other
features designed to maintain the evidential integrity of hard drives
and devices. These features allow an investigator to manage access to
devices as well as ensuring a sterile work environment.

These features include (but are not limited to) the following;

- Dual Boot DVD
- Disk Arbitration
- Clearing The Work Drive
- Rescanning The Hardware Bus
- Attaching & Detaching Disk Images
- Online Version Checking
- Terminal Access

### Dual Boot DVD

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) now comes either as a
download or as a dual boot DVD that is both Intel and PowerPC Mac ready.
So whether the forensics investigator is running a new or older
workstation, he or she should be able to boot onto the DVD so long as
the workstation possesses a DVD-Rom drive.

### Disk Arbitration

When connecting a suspect drive via FireWire or USB to the
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) system that’s already
up and running, OS X is notified of the event by the kernel and will
immediately look for mountable partitions on the drive. If found, the OS
initiates the mount, then the internal disk arbitration tables are
updated with the proper information, which eventually updates any
programs that subscribed to notifications. During the process, the
suspect’s drive will also be updated.

In order to prevent writing to the suspect device accidentally,
[SubRosaSoft](http://www.SubRosaSoft.com) strongly recommends the use of
a write blocking device when performing any operations. Without the use
of a write blocking device, make sure Disk Arbitration is turned off
before connecting the suspect drive to the system running
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com).

Carelessness on this procedure may render the evidence useless and
results in many wasted hours and human effort.

### Clearing The Work Drive

When you drag a file or a folder into the Trash and select "Empty
Trash", your computer informs the operating system that the space the
file previously resided is available for new files. The old file or
folder still resides on your disk, you just cannot get to it. Similarly,
initializing the drive will not rid the drive of data. Data recovery
software such as [SubRosaSoft’s
FileSalvage](http://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1)
will easily recover data that wasn't securely erased.

To ensure the data recovered from the drive does not accidentally
contain data from the previous case,
[SubRosaSoft](http://www.SubRosaSoft.com) strongly recommends you
starting with a new drive with each new case. If a new drive for a new
case is not feasible and it is necessary to recycle a drive for evidence
gathering, you should use
[MacForensicsLab™'s](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) Clear Work Drive
feature to make sure the drive doesn't contain any data that doesn't
belong to the current case.

The Clear Work Drive command can be used to clear a device or a volume
by writing repeated passes of various data patterns.
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) also allows you to
permanently erase the free space on your volume in a secure fashion by
first filling up your volume with temporary files, and then writing a
secure pattern over the files.

### Rescanning The Hardware Bus

If an external drive was not on when you started the computer, and only
after you launched [MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com)
that you switched it on,
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) may not recognize the
device until it rescans the hardware bus. To force a rescan, select
Rescan under the File menu or enter <Command-R>

### Attaching & Detaching Disk Images

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) can also work with
physical devices or disk images. To access the disk image, select
"Attach Disk Image" from the "File" menu. Navigate to and select the
image, and click on "Open".

### Online Version Checking

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) will check our
website each time it is used to check if there is a more recent version
of itself available for download. You can disable this check by using
the menu command "Disable Web Check" at any time and it will not effect
the operation of the software in any way. You can re-enable the check at
any time by using the menu command "Enable Web Check".

No identifying information is transmitted by the software, and there are
no effects from disabling the check or rendering the software incapable
of contacting our website by disconnecting from the internet.

### Terminal Access

[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) provides the
investigator with quick access via the "File" menu to a terminal window,
so that he or she does not have to leave
[MacForensicsLab™](http://www.MacForensicsLab.com) in order to run
commands through the Command Line Interface.
