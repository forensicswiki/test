AutopsyÂ® is an easy to use, GUI-based program that allows you to
efficiently analyze hard drives and smart phones. It has a plug-in
architecture that allows you to find add-on modules or develop custom
modules in Java or Python.

**Autopsy** uses [The Sleuth Kit](the_sleuth_kit.md) for file
system analysis. It can analyze [Windows](windows.md),
[MacOS](mac_os_x.md), and [UNIX](unix.md) disks, as well as
cell phone dumps and collections of individual files. There are many
third-party plug-in modules.
