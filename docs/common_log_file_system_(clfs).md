The **Common Log File System** (**CLFS**) is a special purpose file
(sub)system designed for transaction logging and/or recovery. The CLFS
is not a file system in the traditional meaning of a disk file system,
but more of a logical (special purpose) file system that operates in
combination with a disk file system like [NTFS](ntfs.md).

## Overview

A CLFS log consists of a base log file (.blf) and one or more container
files.

There are two types of logs:

- dedicated logs; contains a single stream of log records.
- multiplexed (or common) logs; contains several streams of log records.

## Implementation

According to Wikipedia CLFS was introduced in Windows server 2003 R2.

In Windows Vista the CLFS is implemented as a driver named: clfs.sys.
User space equivalent functionality is provided by clfsw32.dll, which
communicates to the driver by DeviceIoControl calls.
