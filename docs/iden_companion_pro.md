Motorola has discontinued support of Companion Pro as their new but
inferior "[iDEN Phonebook Manager](iden_phonebook_manager.md)"
software has been released.

You can still use the new Phonebook Manager, if you don't care about
speed dial ordering (like holding "1" to call home, etc.), or
cut-and-paste to copy contacts from an Excel spreadsheet instead of
entering 1 by 1 with their awkward interface.
