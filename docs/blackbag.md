With regards to computer forensics, "**black bag**" operations usually
consist of the acquisition of [digital
evidence](digital_evidence.md) without the target's knowledge.

This type of operation is especially useful during internal affairs or
ongoing criminal investigations. Depending on the sensitivity of the
investigation, access to the target's computer is sometimes facilitated
by the target's superiors by giving the evidence collection specialist
intelligence to bypass physical security
devices during the operation. It should also be noted that during this
type of operation, it is also possible to install applications and
configure a computer system to further the investigation from a remote
location.

According to the [FBI's own web
page](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/freedom-of-informationprivacy-act), the term "black
bag" is coined from a practice used by that agency between 1942 and
1967. During that time, the [FBI](fbi.md) illegally obtained
evidence against several individuals/organizations by entering their
offices and obtaining photographs of information found in their records.
The practice was ordered to be discontinued by then FBI Director Hoover.
