File is a command-line tool that attempts to identify the type of data and
format within the file. It has three tests: filesystem, magic number, and
language, which are performed in that order. The result of first test that
finds a match is returned. These heuristics are fairly simplistic and can
easily be fooled.

The filesystem test examines the filetype and name of the file under
examination, looking for execution flags and common filenames like *core*. The
magic number test examines the first few bytes of a file in order to identify
its type. The language test checks to see if the file is a text file and
attempts to recover which encoding is being used for the text.

Other things I'd like to see on this page are: command-line usage, examples,
and uses for forensic investigation.

## Identifying Partitions with File

File can identify disk partitions too!
