DNA is the Distributed Network Attack, a password cracking system sold
by [AccessData](accessdata.md).

DNA can perform brute-force cracking of 40-bit RC2/RC4 keys. For longer
keys, DNA can attempt password cracking. (It's computationally
infeasable to attempt a brute-force attack on a 128-bit key.)

DNA can mine suspects hard drive for potential passwords.
