**Palm OS** is an embedded operating system initially developed by U.S.
Robotics' owned Palm Computing, Inc. for personal digital assistants
(PDAs) in 1996. Palm OS is designed for ease of use with a
touchscreen-based graphical user interface. It is provided with a suite
of basic applications for personal information management. Besides Palm,
several other licensees have manufactured devices powered by Palm OS.
The currently licensed version from ACCESS is now called Garnet OS, as
the Palm trademark belongs to Palm, Inc.
