**Palm OS** is an embedded operating system initially developed by U.S.
Robotics' owned Palm Computing, Inc. for personal digital assistants (PDAs) in
1996. Palm OS is designed for ease of use with a touchscreen-based graphical
user interface. It is provided with a suite of basic applications for personal
information management. Besides Palm, several other licensees have manufactured
devices powered by Palm OS.  The currently licensed version from ACCESS is now
called Garnet OS, as the Palm trademark belongs to Palm, Inc.
