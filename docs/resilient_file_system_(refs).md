The Resilient File System (ReFS) (AKA protogon) was introduced in
[Windows 8](windows.md), with the intention of eventually
replacing [NTFS](ntfs.md). It has been designed for use with
huge data sets, and provides improvements over NTFS with features such
as repairing errors "on-the-go" (automatic chkdsk) and preventing Torn
Writes by using a "Copy-On-Write" feature.
