### 2000 Michelle Theer

*E-mails document the conspiracy to murder her husband*

On Dec. 17, 2000, John Diamond shot and killed Air Force Capt. Marty
Theer. "There \[was\] no direct evidence, no eyewitness evidence. There
is no physical evidence. There is no confusion," said Theer's attorney
Daniel Pollitt[^1] after the conviction. But what prosecutors did have
was 88,000 e-mails and instant messages on Theer's computer, including
personal ads that Theer had written in 1999, web-mail that she had
written in response to those ads, clear evidence of a sexual
relationship between Theer and Diamond, and messages documenting the
conspiracy to murder Theer's husband. Theer was found guilty on December
3, 2004 of murder and conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison[^2].

### 2002 Scott Tyree

*Postings on Yahoo reveal a kidnapping*

On January 1st, 2002, Scott Tyree kidnapped and imprisoned 13-year-old
Alicia Kozakiewicz. That night Tyree sent an instant message of a
photograph of Kozakiewicz bound in his basement to another man in Tampa,
FL. The second man checked the Pit tsburgh Post-Gazette website and saw
that a girl was in fact missing from her parent's home. The man
contacted the FBI on January 3rd and provided the Yahoo screen name of
the person who had sent the IM: "masterforteenslavegirls". FBI
investigators contacted Yahoo to obtained the IP address for the person
who had used the screen name, then contacted Verizon to learn the name
and physical address of the Verizon subscriber to whom that IP address
had been assigned. It was Scott William Tyree.

### 2005 [Dennis Rader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader) --- The "BTK" Serial Killer

After eluding police for more than 30 years, a serial killer in Kansas
re-emerged, took another victim, and then sent police a floppy disk with
a letter on it. On the disk forensic investigators found a deleted
Microsoft Word file. Inside that file's metadata was metadata containing
the name "Dennis" as the last person to modify the deleted file and a
link to the Lutheran Church, where Rader was a Deacon. (Ironically,
Rader had sent a floppy disk to the police because he had been
previously told, by the police themselves, that letters on floppy disks
could not be traced.)

### 2005 Corey Beantee Melton

*Caught up in child pornography*

Melton brought his malfunctioning home computer to Best Buy's Geek
Squad. The Squad found numerous computer viruses on the system. Melton
left his computer with the store. Subsequent analysis by the store found
that some of the viruses kept re-attaching themselves to movies. When
the squad looked at the videos they determined that they were child
pornography and contacted the police.

### 2007 James Kent

*University Professor caught up in child pornography*

In 1999, James Kent, a professor of public administration at Maris
College in Poughkeepsie, NY, started a researching child pornography for
a book that he was planning on the topic. In June 2000 he abandoned the
project and deleted his copies of the files. In 2005 his computer was
replaced by the college, but the files from his old computer were copied
to the new computer. In 2007 Kent, now 63, complained to his school's IT
department that his college-provided computer not functioning properly.
In the course of running a virus scan the school's IT department
discovered a large number of pictures of "of very young girls, some
scantily dressed in sexually suggestive poses." Kent maintained that the
photos were left over from his research efforts and that he did not have
access to the files. Kent is charged with 141 counts of possession in
child pornography. In the appeal the court throws out one count, arguing
that Kent did not know that viewing child pornography online made a copy
of the pornography in his web browser's cache.

### 2008 Brad Cooper

Brad Cooper was arrested for the murder of his wife Nancy Cooper. At
Cooper's murder trial, Det. Jim Young described how he had attempted to
access text messages on the phone but instead wiped the phone's memory
by repeatedly entering incorrect SIM lock codes and PUK codes. The
defense team argued that an "inept" police investigation ignored and
destroyed important evidence that would have shown Cooper's innocence.

### 2009 James M. Cameron

*Assistant attorney general for Maine caught up in child pornography*

On February 17, 2009, James M. Cameron was indicated on 16 charges of
trafficking in child pornography. Prosecutors alleged that between July
2006 and January 2008 Cameron had uploaded child pornography to a Yahoo
photo album using five different aliases. According to an order by a
federal judge dated Sept. 28, 2009, ""It begins with two referrals from
the (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) to the Maine
State Police on August 3, 2007, and September 6, 2007, which itself had
been triggered by a report from the Internet Service Provider Yahoo.
Yahoo reported locating numerous images of child pornography in the
photos section of a Yahoo! account.

"The Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit undertook an investigation
and ultimately identified the owner of the account to be Barbara
Cameron, the defendant's wife. Further investigation confirmed that Mr.
Cameron was an assistant attorney general for the state of Maine, and
that some of the pornography involved children as young as 4 to 6 years
old engaging in sexual conduct....On December 21, 2007, the state
executed a search warrant and seized four computers. When the computers
were examined, there was evidence of Internet chat between two users
about sex with children, images of child pornography and related
topics....In one of those conversations, the person identified himself
as a married 45-year-old man with a daughter, a description that fits
Mr. Cameron."
