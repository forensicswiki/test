**Unix** or **UNIX** is a general-purpose multi-user [operating system](operating_system.md)
developed mostly by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie during 1969 at Bell Labs.
About one year later during the early 1970s UNIX was unveiled to the general
public. The original goal as it is today was to create a stable, secure, and
powerful operating system that is portable to many different hardware platforms

Today UNIX has evolved into three main categories which all flavors of UNIX
derive from: [BSD](bsd.md), System V Release 4, and hybrid. Some of the most
poplar flavors of UNIX are:

* IBM’s [AIX](aix.md)
* [Sun Microsystems](sun_microsystems_inc.md)' [Solaris](solaris.md)
* SGI’s IRIX
* [Linux](linux.md)
* [OpenBSD](openbsd.md)
* [FreeBSD](freebsd.md)
