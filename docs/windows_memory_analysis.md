Analysis of [physical memory](physical_memory.md) from
[Windows](windows.md) systems can yield significant information
about the target operating system. This field is still very new, but
holds great promise.

## Data types

Data types typical to the WINAPI are documented by Microsoft in MS-DTYP
[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/cca27429-5689-4a16-b2b4-9325d93e4ba2).

## Sample Memory Images

Getting started with memory analysis can be difficult without some known
images to practice with.

* The 2005 [DFRWS: Memory Analysis Challenge](https://github.com/dfrws/dfrws2005-challenge)
  published two Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 memory images with some malware
  installed.
* The [Digital Forensics Tool Testing](https://dftt.sourceforge.net/)
  project has published a few [Windows memory images](https://dftt.sourceforge.net/test13/index.html).
* The CFReDS Project has created some
  [downloadable memory images](https://cfreds.nist.gov/mem/memory-images.rar).
* A number of RAM images can be downloaded from
  <https://belkasoft.com/x>. Images include
  ones with Gmail emails, Skype activity, Paltalk chats, browser URLs
  etc.

## History

During the 1990s, it became a best practice
to capture a [memory image](tools_memory_imaging.md) during
[incident response](incident_response.md). At the time, the only
way to analyze such memory images was using
[strings](strings.md). Although this method could reveal
interesting details about the memory image, there was no way to
associate what data came from what program, let alone what user.

In the summer 2005 the [Digital Forensic Research Workshop](digital_forensic_research_workshop.md)
published a *Memory Analysis Challenge*. They distributed two memory images and
asked researchers to answer a number of questions about a security incident.
The challenge produced two seminal works. The first, by Chris Betz,
introduced a tool called memparser. The second, by [George Garner](george_garner.md)
and Robert-Jan Mora produced KnTList.

At the [Blackhat Federal](blackhat_(conference).md) conference in March 2007,
[AAron Walters](aaron_walters.md) and [Nick Petroni](nick_petroni.md) released
a suite called Volatools. Although it only worked on Windows XP Service Pack 2
images, it was able to produce a number of useful data. Volatools was updated
and re-released as Volatility in August
2007, and is now maintained and distributed by [Volatile Systems](https://www.volatilesystems.com/).
