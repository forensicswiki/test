**Twofish** is an [encryption](encryption.md) algorithm designed designed by
[Bruce Schneier](bruce_schneier.md), John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner,
Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for
the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES](aes.md) competition, where it got third
place with 31 votes (Rijndael got 86 votes, and was selected by [NIST](nist.md)
as the [AES](aes.md), and [Serpent](serpent.md).

Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key
sizes up to 256 bits. It is related to the earlier [Blowfish](blowfish.md)
block cipher, also designed by [Bruce Schneier](bruce_schneier.md).
