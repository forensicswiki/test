**aimage** (the **advanced imager**) was an
[imaging](imaging.md) tool that was part of
[AFF](aff.md).

**aimage** can create files in raw, AFF, AFD, or AFM formats. AFF and
AFD formats can be compressed or uncompressed.
[aimage](aimage.md) can optionally compress and calculate
[MD5](md5.md) or [SHA-1](sha.md) hash residues while
the data is being copied. It had intelligent error recovery, similar to
what is in [ddrescue](ddrescue.md).

*'aimage* was withdrawn from support (December 25, 2010)

Linux distributions that packaged **image** are encouraged to drop it
and package guymager instead.
