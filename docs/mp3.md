The **MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3** format is a commonly-used lossy music format.

## Format

MP3 files consist of a well defined [header](header.md), music
data, and optional [metadata](metadata.md) which may be at the
beginning or end of the file, depending on the version of
[ID3](id3.md) used.

## Metadata

MP3 files may contain ID3 meta-information, including information about
the software used to create the MP3.

## Steganography

Using programs such as [MP3Stego](mp3stego.md), MP3 files may be
used as a base for steganographic content.
