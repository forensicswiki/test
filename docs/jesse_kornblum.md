## Tools

[md5deep](md5deep.md) and [hashdeep](hashdeep.md) -
Cross platform recursive [hashing](hashing.md) and auditing
programs, respectively. Computes MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger and
Whirlpool hashes. Can also match against sets of known hashes. The
latter program uses [multihashing](multihashing.md) to conduct a
computer forensics audit.

[foremost](foremost.md) - File [carving](file_carving.md)
program

[ssdeep](ssdeep.md) - Usually called Fuzzy Hashing, this program
implements [Context Triggered Piecewise
Hashing](context_triggered_piecewise_hashing.md).

[FRED](first_responder's_evidence_disk.md) - The First
Responder's Evidence Disk

[dc3dd](dc3dd.md) - A patch to add forensics features to [GNU
dd](dd.md)

[Miss Identify](miss_identify.md) - Program to identify Win32
executables that don't have an executable extension. Can also identify
all executables.
