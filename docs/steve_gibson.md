## Overview

Steve Gibson is the President and Founder of Gibson Research
Corporation, CA, USA. From 1986 to 1993 he was a columnist and editor
for InfoWorld Magazine. In the past he has also held positions with
Hovik Corporation and as an Independent Consultant. Gibson Research's
most well known product is the disk recovery tool known as SpinRite.
However the last major release of SpinRite was V6.0, released in 2004,
and development then appears to have stalled as Steve has been working
on other projects.

Steve has also developed a number of free utilities, such as Shield's Up
and produced a series of well researched pod-casts on personal computer
security.
