Follow-up Workshop for Digital Forensics Educators

This is a short note to invite you back to the Follow-up Workshop for
Digital Forensics Educators at Erie Community College, Tuesday, August
16, 2011 from 9-4. If you hadn’t participated last year…you’re still
invited.

Dr. Garfinkel has requested that we have a more interactive workshop
with participants sharing their methodologies and course work with the
group. This would facilitate more sharing amongst colleagues and give
him a better focus regarding the forensics corpora course integration.

We would like to start lining up presenters so that the program can
start taking shape. The format for sharing can be as simple as a short
talk about your program or PPTs or group activities. Please respond with
what you would like to do. I look forward to seeing you in August.
Regards, Donna
