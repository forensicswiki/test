## Overview

Tcpdstat is an old, but useful tool for analyzing network based
evidence. Tcpdstat offers very helpful statistical information about
packet captures, including start/finish timestamps (to identify the
total duration of the packet capture), breakdown by protocol/port, and
packet size distribution.

Tcpdstat is useful for analyzing network trace data because it gives a
high-level overview, which can identify where to look next. For example,
if quite a few packets show up for a protocol/port that isnâ€™t normally
used on the victim machine, you've already been clued in on what to look
for next on a lower level.
