**Serpent** is an [encryption](encryption.md) algorithm designed by Ross
Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption
Standard [AES](aes.md) competition, where it got second place with 59 votes
Rijndael got 86 votes, and was selected by [NIST](nist.md) as the
[AES](aes.md)).

Serpent uses a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128, 192 or
256 bits.

Serpent and Rijndael are somewhat similar. The main difference is that Rijndael
has fewer rounds (10, 12 or 14 (depending on key size) compared to 32 for
Serpent), hence it is faster. Arguably, Serpent is more secure.

Serpent is available as public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.
