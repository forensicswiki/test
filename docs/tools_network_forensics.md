NetworkMiner

NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows.
NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing
tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open
ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can
also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble
transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files. The purpose of
NetworkMiner is to collect data (such as forensic evidence) about hosts
on the network rather than to collect data regarding the traffic on the
network. The main view is host centric (information grouped per host)
rather than packet centric (information showed as a list of
packets/frames). NetworkMiner has, since the first release in 2007,
become popular tool among incident responce teams as well as law
enforcement. NetworkMiner is today used by companies and organizations
all over the world.

NetworkMiner is available both as a [free open source
tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/networkminer/) and as a
[commercial network forensics
tool](http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner).
