# Network Forensics Packages and Appliances

[E-Detective](https://www.edecision4u.com/)

[CapAnalysis](https://www.capanalysis.net/ca/)

**Open Source** web visual tool for information security specialists,
system administrators and everyone who needs to analyze large amounts of
captured network traffic.

CapAnalysis performs indexing of data set of PCAP files and presents
their contents in many forms, starting from a list of TCP, UDP or ESP
streams/flows, passing to the geo-graphical representation of the
connections.

[Demo](https://pcap.capanalysis.net/)

[chkrootkit](https://www.chkrootkit.org/)

[cryptcat](https://farm9.org/Cryptcat/)

[Enterasys Dragon](https://www.extremenetworks.com/)

Instrusion Detection System, includes session reconstruction.

[MNIS Collector](https://www.mantaro.com)
MNIS Collector is an IPFIX collector which also supports legacy Netflow.
It was designed to be used with the MNIS Exporter, which is a Deep
Packet Inspection probe that can be used to decode 300+ protocols on up
to 20 Gbps and report the information in IPFIX.

[Mantaro Network Intelligence Solutions (mnis)](https://www.mantaro.com)

MNIS is a comprehensive and scalable network intelligence platform for
network forensics and various other applications. It is built on high
speed Deep Packet Inspection and metadata alerting. It can be used to
understand network events before and after an event. It scales from LAN
environments to 20 Gbps service provider networks.

[MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)

[IP geolocation](ip_geolocation.md) services and data provider
for offline geotagging. Free GeoLite country database. Programmable

[netcat](netcat.md)

[SiLK](https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/index.html)

[Netstat](netstat.md)

[NetSleuth](http://www.netgrab.co.uk/)

NetSleuth is a free network analysis tool released under the GPL.
NetSleuth can be used to analyse and fingerprint hosts from pcap files,
designed for post event incident response and network forensics. It also
supports a live sniffing mode, silently identifying and fingerprinting
devices without needing to send any traffic onto a network.

NetworkMiner

NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows.
NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing
tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open
ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can
also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble
transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files. The purpose of
NetworkMiner is to collect data (such as forensic evidence) about hosts
on the network rather than to collect data regarding the traffic on the
network. The main view is host centric (information grouped per host)
rather than packet centric (information showed as a list of
packets/frames). NetworkMiner has, since the first release in 2007,
become popular tool among incident responce teams as well as law
enforcement. NetworkMiner is today used by companies and organizations
all over the world.

NetworkMiner is available both as a [free open source
tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/networkminer/) and as a
[commercial network forensics
tool](https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner).
