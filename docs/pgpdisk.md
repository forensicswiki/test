**PGPDisk** was a disk encryption solution from the [PGP
Corporation](http://www.pgp.com). It has since been rebranded as [PGP
Whole Disk Encryption](pgp_whole_disk_encryption.md).

It provides transparent whole disk encryption with Pre-Boot
authentification for Windows. Also supports MacOS X 10.4 (non-boot disks
only).

In 2007 an undocumented encryption bypass feature was found that allowed
the drive to be accessed even without the boot-up password

The PGP Corporation said that the feature had been requested by
enterprise users and was not a backdoor
