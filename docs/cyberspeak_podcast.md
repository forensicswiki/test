alt="Cyberspeak.jpg" /> An podcast by [Bret
Padres](bret_padres.md) and [Ovie
Carroll](ovie_carroll.md), both former agents of the [Air Force
Office of Special
Investigations](air_force_office_of_special_investigations.md),
since 4 Dec 2005. The show usually features at least one interview,
although some shows do not have any. The hosts also discuss current
issues in the field and give links to new or interesting websites. A
set of detailed show notes are usually posted to a separate website,
although the link is given on the [show's official
website](http://cyberspeak.libsyn.com/).
