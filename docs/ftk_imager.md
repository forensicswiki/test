The **Forensic Toolkit Imager** (**FTK Imager**) is a commercial
forensic [imaging](imaging.md) software package distributed by
[AccessData](accessdata.md).

FTK Imager supports storage of disk images in EnCase's or
[SMART](smart.md)'s file format, as well as in raw
([dd](dd.md) format. With Isobuster technology built in, [FTK
Imager](ftk_imager.md) Images CD's to a
ISO/[CUE](cue_sheet_format.md) file combination. This also
includes multi and open session CDs.

## Notes

- **Important**: when using FTK Imager to create a forensic image of a
  suspect's [hard drive](hard_drive.md), make sure you are using
  a hardware-based [write blocking device](write_blockers.md).
  This ensures that your [operating system](operating_system.md)
  does not alter the suspect's hard drive when you attach the drive to
  your computer.
