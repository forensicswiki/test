YAFFS2 (Yet Another Flash File System) is a file system which is used in
many modern smartphones and which is build for NAND and NOR flash.
Although YAFFS2 is an open standard and there exists an open source
implementation, the behavior of YAFFS2 is not very well understood. Ad-
ditionally, several aspects like wear-leveling and garbage- collection
are not well-specified in the standard.
