The **System Acquisition Forensic Environment (SAFE) Boot Disk** is the
first and only commercially available forensically sound Windows Boot
disk by [ForensicSoft](forensicsoft.md). SAFE is a fully
licensed version of Windows PE protected that is protected by the proven
[SAFE Block XP](safe_block_xp.md) software write blocking
technology.

**SAFE Boot Disk** now allows you to boot any x86-based computer without
the need to remove the drives or worry about the need for special
adapters or controller cards. Because **SAFE Boot Disk** is based on
Windows PE it includes built in driver support as well as the ability to
easily install any drivers that may be missing. This also means the
**Safe Boot Disk** includes built in support for the NTFS file system
without the need for third party tools and has the ability to write to
NTFS and NTFS compressed file systems, taking advantage of larger
partition sizes, larger file size limits and the advantage of native
NTFS compression.

In order to ensure the **SAFE Boot Disk** is a forensically sound Live
CD it has the proven write blocking technology used by [SAFE Block
XP](safe_block_xp.md) built in to ensure that upon booting every
attached disk and flash device are automatically blocked without any
required user interaction. Unlike some of the Linux Live CD's this is
true write blocking and not just mounting read-only or not
auto-mounting.

Finally **SAFE Boot Disk** provides access to Host Protected Areas
(HPAs) and Device Configuration Overlay (DCOs) on IDE (PATA and SATA)
disks, has built in Case Logging and built in tools for exploration,
viewing, and simple forensics functions.
