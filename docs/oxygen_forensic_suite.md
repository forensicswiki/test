**Oxygen Forensic Suite** is a mobile forensic software for logical analysis of
[cell phones](cell_phones.md), [smartphones](smartphones.md) and
[PDAs](pdas.md) developed by [Oxygen Software](oxygen_software.md).

The suite can extract device information, contacts, calendar events,
[SMS](sms.md) messages, event logs, and files. In addition, the vendor claims
the suite can extract metadata related to the above.

As of December 2014 the suite supported more than 8,400 devices, including
[Nokia](nokia.md), [Apple iPhone](apple_iphone.md) series, Apple iPod Touch,
Apple iPad, Vertu, [Sony Ericsson](sony_ericsson.md), Samsung, Motorola,
[Blackberry](blackberry.md), Panasonic, Siemens, HTC, HP, E-Ten, Gigabyte,
i-Mate, Chinese (Mediatek) Phones and other mobile phones. The suite also
supports devices running [Symbian OS](symbian.md), [Windows Mobile
5/6](microsoft_windows_mobile.md), Microsoft Windows Phone 8 and [Android OS
devices](android.md).

## Forensic Soundness

The suite access devices using advanced proprietary protocols. Some devices
like smartphones require an Agent installation. Of course, installing software
onto the device being examined will impact the forensic soundness of the
investigation. If such information is not obtainable by other means and the
impact is documented, it may still be admissible under the Best Evidence Rule.
