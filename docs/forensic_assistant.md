The program "Forensic Assistant" was designed for computer forensic
experts that work for state institutions and institutions performing
expert examinations for fee. The program was developed by the designers
that have a many years' experience in performing expert examinations and
working in the field of computer security. This fact helped to make this
program convenient for practical application.

## Overview

The program is oriented to the practicing forensic experts who would
like to perform correct forensic examinations.

*The program helps to find and analyze important forensic information in
the programs, logs and files as follows:*

1.  instant messengers ([icq](icq.md), ICQ Lite, &RQ/R&Q,
    Trillian, QIP, QIP Infium, Miranda, VyPress Chat, Mail.ru Agent,
    [Skype](skype.md) - contact-lists and users'
    correspondence;
2.  message exchange logs (NetSpeakerPhone, Counter-Strike) - users'
    correspondence;
3.  bases of e-mail programs ([outlook](outlook.md) -
    deleted and explicit email messages;
4.  OS [Windows](windows.md) - analysis
    of all file areas including LEAK blocks;
5.  OS [Windows](windows.md) -
    information about flash memory cards that were connected to the
    computer and all connections to the Internet;
6.  OS [Windows](windows.md) service files (\*.pf,
    \*.[lnk](lnk.md) - addresses of
    the files that were opened, etc.;
7.  OS [Windows registry](windows_registry.md) files;
8.  Service files of browser programs ([Internet Explorer](internet_explorer.md),
    [Opera](opera.md), [Firefox](firefox.md);
9.  Documents made in OLE2 format (including metadata extraction and
    description). "Forensic Assistant" is one of few programs subjected
    to low level analysis. This program is able to display real dates of
    file modifications.

The above said file formats (except [Firefox](firefox.md) and
ICQ6) are subjected to the low level analysis and it helps to analyze
and obtain available information even from damaged files. Adapted by a
special method algorithms were used in the program, so it helps to
reduce the time that is necessary for the process of examination.

*Additional options:*

1.  Creation file copies in accordance with a list of files. In this
    case a file path is preserved ("clean" list, "Kaspersky Antivirus"
    log, "AVSearch" log).
2.  Coding and decoding the information given in base64 (MIME) format.
3.  Decoding of files and file fragments that were coded by use of the
    operations DEC, ADD, XOR (for example, installation of malicious
    software).
4.  *Bases containing several thousands of ICQ numbers with nicknames
    and types of activity indicated. Those ICQ numbers were used by
    Russian network frauders, carders, spammers, hackers, virusmakers
    and spreaders of malicious software.*
5.  USB-device write blocker (for OS [Windows](windows.md) XP
    SP2+/Vista).
6.  Utility "RegWalker" for operating on the inactive registry of the OS
    Windows including review of registry using read-only mode.
7.  Utility "Hash Sets" that is used for performing the operations as
    follows: hash bases making, file detection with those bases, file
    groups comparing (including a program and its distribution kit).

*Functional peculiarities:*

1.  Results are given in tables. Sorting in every field of a table and
    search of a text string (including the search carried out in
    accordance with a list) are available.
2.  Results may be exported to a text file (RTF) or an Excel file (CSV)
    (for this process desktop apps are not necessary to be installed in
    an expert's computer).
3.  To detect associates and criminal connections, all the message
    exchange program settings and contact lists of the program users may
    be automatically checked by use of an integrated ICQ numbers base.
4.  Information search and analysis also may be carried out in the
    archives of 14 formats.
5.  Detection of password protected archives and some files of
    cryptographic programs.
6.  Multilanguage interface (language files in the Russian and English
    languages are included into distribution kit).
7.  Preview of the found files as a text, hex-dump and a graphics file.
8.  Control of software modules integrity.
9.  Open interface for connecting software modules that were developed
    by other authors (for example by user's of the program).
