**Kismet** is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector,
[sniffer](sniffer.md), and intrusion detection system.

## Overview

* [Wireshark](wireshark.md)/[Tcpdump](tcpdump.md)
  compatible data logging;
* Airsnort compatible weak-iv packet logging;
* Network IP range detection;
* Built-in channel hopping and multicard split channel hopping;
* Hidden network SSID decloaking;
* Graphical mapping of networks;
* Client/server architecture allows multiple clients to view a single
  Kismet server simultaneously;
* Manufacturer and model identification of access points and clients;
* Detection of known default access point configurations;
* Runtime decoding of WEP packets for known networks;
* Named pipe output for integration with other tools, such as a layer3
  IDS like [Snort](snort.md);
* Multiplexing of multiple simultaneous capture sources on a single
  Kismet instance;
* Distributed remote drone sniffing;
* [XML](xml.md) output;
* Over 20 supported card types.

## Intrusion Detection

Kismet will detect following events:

* Active network scanning (NetStumbler, PocketStumbler, etc);
* SSID brute force attempts;
* Broadcast disconnect/deauthenticate attacks;
* Deauthenticate/disassociate flood;
* Fake APs (new AP on another channel, invalid BSS timestamps);
* Many DoS attacks (zero-length SSID, over-long SSID, etc).
