## Description

Oxygen Forensic Plist Viewer automatically unpacks a plist file and
displays its content as a folder tree. The expert can view data, convert
text entries to different encodings, and convert numeric values to Unix,
Windows, or iOS dates. Whatâ€™s more, the program can show binary content
of cells, such as images, video and sound and export the content of a
plist file to XML format for further analysis in other forensic
software.

Viewing a plist file in Oxygen Forensic Plist Viewer is very easy.
Simply select a node of a plist file in the folder tree, and its content
will open in the viewer. For example, if the user downloaded a file from
the file sharing website, the investigator can see a direct link to that
file, date of downloading, title of the webpage the file was downloaded
from, as well as the number of visits to that webpage. In case of
viewing binary content, the tool will detect its format and display an
image, or play a sound automatically.
