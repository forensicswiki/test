Computer forensics is the practice of identifying, extracting and
considering evidence from digital media such as computer hard drives.
[Digital evidence](digital_evidence.md) is both fragile and
volatile and requires the attention of a certified specialist to ensure
that materials of evidentiary value can be effectively isolated and
extracted in a scientific manner that will bear the scrutiny of a court
of law.

Computer forensics is not to be confused with the more generic term of
'forensic computing', which refers to the analysis and study of all
types of digital media and materials - whether they be of a computing or
telecommunication nature. Computer forensics, in a strict sense, applies
specifically to the evaluation of computers and data storage or data
processing devices.

## Background

Forensic science is the scientific method of gathering and examining
information about the past. The word forensic comes from the Latin
forÄ“nsis, meaning "of or before the forum." In modern use, the term
forensics in the place of forensic science can be considered correct, as
the term forensic is effectively a synonym for legal or related to
courts. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science).

Most legal systems apply a form of a legal burden of proof. A legal
burden of proof is the imperative on a party in a trial to produce the
evidence that will shift the conclusion away from the default position
to one's own position.

## Forensics examinations

Four things are key to all forensics examinations; the:

1.  Maintenance of data integrity as well as data authenticity,
2.  Prevention of contamination of data,
3.  Proper and comprehensive documentation and
4.  Implementation of a systematic, scientific methodology

## Forensic profession

All professionals involved in a forensics examination have both an
ethical and a professional responsibility to:

- Maintain their objectivity.
- Present facts accurately and
- Not withhold any findings as such actions may distort or misrepresent
  the facts
- Render opinions only on the basis of what can be reasonably
  demonstrated.

## Terminology

### Artifact

The term artifact (or artefact) is widely used within computer
forensics, though there is no official definition of this term.

The definition closest to the meaning of the word within computer
forensics is that of the word artifact within archaeology
[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)). The term
should not be confused with the word artifact used within software
development
[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)).

If archaeology defines an artifact as:

    something made or given shape by man, such as a tool or a work of art, esp an object of archaeological interest

The definition of artifact within computer forensics could be:

    An object of digital archaeological interest.

Where digital archaeological roughly refers to computer forensics
without the forensic (legal) context.
