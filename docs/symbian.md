**Symbian** is an open operating system, designed for mobile devices,
with associated libraries, user interface frameworks and reference
implementations of common tools, produced by Symbian Ltd. Symbian
evolved from [Psion](psion.md)'s [EPOC](epoch.md) in
1998. Symbian OS is currently owned by [BenQ](benq.md),
[Ericsson](ericsson.md), [Panasonic](panasonic.md),
[Nokia](nokia.md), [Siemens AG](siemens_ag.md) and [Sony
Ericsson](sony_ericsson.md). ![](Symbian.png "Symbian.png")

## Versions

There are several variations of the Symbian OS that are tailored for
different devices. The capabilities of the Symbian OS depend on the
device for which it was tailored. Each variation is called a *Device
Family Reference Design* (*DFRD*).

### DFRDs

Device Family Reference Designs (DFRDs) are variations of Symbian OS
tailored for different types of mobile information devices including one
for smart phones, one for pen-based communicators, and another for
keyboard-based communicators. There are three DFRDs: Crystal, Pearl, and
Quartz.

### Crystal

Crystal is a DFRD tailored for feature-rich, communicator-type devices.
Hardware platforms are phones with a full keyboard and a relatively
large, landscape-oriented display. Crystal devices are designed for
business users who need a lot of information.

### Pearl

Pearl is a DFRD for a Symbian [smart phone](smart_phone.md).
Hardware platforms typically look like standard [cell
phones](cell_phones.md) with small displays and limited
keyboards.

### Quartz

Quartz is a DFRD for a pen-based phone similar to the
[Palm](palm.md) [PDAs](pdas.md). Hardware platforms do
not include keyboards, and the relatively large displays are
portrait-oriented (vertical). Quartz devices are designed for consumer
users and are geared toward information gathering.

## History

Symbian is a joint venture between Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson,
Matsushita, and Psion that became independent in June 1998. Symbian was
established by leaders in the computing and mobile industries to enable
the mass market of communicators and smart phones. Here is a brief
overview of the milestones in the history of Symbian.

  and is taken out of production before hitting the market.
- 2005 - Symbian OS v9.1 announced.
