The **Integrated Digital Enhanced Network** (**iDEN**) is a proprietary
mobile communications technology from Motorola.
It is a [TDMA](tdma.md) based digital wireless standard that
operates in the 800 MHz, 900MHz, and 1.5 GHz bands. It combines the
capabilities of a [digital cellular telephone](cell_phones.md)
and a two-way radio known as push-to-talk (ptt).

Motorolaâ€™s iDEN technology phones support many other features including
Bluetooth, location-based services, [MOTOTalk](mototalk.md) and support for
expandable memory ([Micro SD](micro_sd.md). [Sprint Nextel](sprint_nextel.md)
is the largest U.S. retailer of iDEN services.

Newer iDEN phones use a [SIM card](sim_cards.md) that is compatible with
[GSM](gsm.md) phones for overseas roaming but iDEN is a very different standard
from GSM. iDEN phones are not compatible with GSM networks and GSM phones are
not compatible with iDEN networks.

## History

iDEN was invented by Motorola who is presently the primary manufacturer
of iDEN devices.

[Nextel](nextel.md) has started to develop a 2.5G technology
called **WiDEN** (an expansion of iDEN) that includes four carriers
(100kHz) into one channel. This results in a much higher download speed
of 96 kbit/s.

## Software

Software for acquiring a iDEN data includes:

* [iDEN Companion Pro](iden_companion_pro.md)
* [iDEN Media Downloader](iden_media_downloader.md)
* [iDEN Phonebook Manager](iden_phonebook_manager.md)
* [SIMiFOR](simifor.md)
* [SIM Explorer](sim_explorer.md)
