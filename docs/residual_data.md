Residual Data is data that is unintentionally left behind on computer
media. In forensic usage, remnant data is typically left behind after
attempts have been made to delete the data, after the data has been
forgotten, or after the media on which the data resides has been
decomissioned.

Residual data appears at all levels of modern computer systems:

- Computer systems that are discarded.
- Partitions in hard drives that are deleted.
- Files on hard drives that are deleted but not overwritten.
- Snippets of text in Microsoft Word files.
- Heap variables that are freed with **free()**
- Automatic variables left on the stack of languages like C or garbage
  collected in languages like Java.
