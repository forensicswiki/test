Analyzing [malware](malware.md), or malicious software, is more of an art than
a technique. Because of the wide nature of these products, there are limitless
ways to hide functionality

Some common tools for malware analysis include simple programs like
[strings](strings.md). More complex analysis can be conducted by looking at the
headers of executables with programs like [PEiD](peid.md) and PeExplorer.
Finally, the most complete analysis can be done with debuggers like
[IDA Pro](ida_pro.md) and OllyDbg.

## Malware techniques

### Process hollowing

Process hollowing is yet another tool in the kit of those who seek to
hide the presence of a process. The idea is rather straight forward: a
bootstrap application creates a seemingly innocent process in a
suspended state. The legitimate image is then unmapped and replaced with
the image that is to be hidden. If the preferred image base of the new
image does not match that of the old image, the new image must be
rebased. Once the new image is loaded in memory the EAX register of the
suspended thread is set to the entry point. The process is then resumed
and the entry point of the new image is executed.
