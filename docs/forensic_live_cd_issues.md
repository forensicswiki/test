## The problem

[Forensic Live CDs](live_cd.md) are widely used during computer
forensic investigations. Currently, many vendors of such Live CD
distributions spread false claims that their distributions "do not touch
anything", "write protect everything" and so on. Unfortunately,
community-developed distributions are no exception here. Finally, it
turns out that many Linux-based forensic Live CDs are not tested
properly and there are no suitable test cases published.

## Another side of the problem

Another side of the problem of insufficient testing of forensic Live CDs
is that many users do not know what happens "under the hood" of the
provided operating system and cannot adequately test them.

### Example

For example, [*Forensic Cop Journal* (Volume 1(3), Oct
2009)](http://forensiccop.blogspot.com/2009/10/forensic-cop-journal-13-2009.html)
describes a test case when an Ext3 file system was mounted using "-o ro"
mount flag as a way to write protect the data. The article says that all
tests were successful (i.e. no data modification was found after
unmounting the file system), but it is known that damaged (i.e not
properly unmounted) Ext3 file systems cannot be write protected using
only "-o ro" mount flags (write access will be enabled during file
system recovery).

And the question is: will many users test damaged Ext3 file system
(together with testing the clean one) when validating their favourite
forensic Live CD distribution? My answer is "no", because many users are
unaware of such traits.

## Problems

Each problem is followed by a list of distributions affected (currently
this list is not up-to-date).

### Journaling file system updates

When mounting (and unmounting) several journaling file systems with only
"-o ro" mount flag a different number of data writes may occur. Here is
a list of such file systems:

| File system | When data writes happen                 | Notes                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ext3        | File system requires journal recovery   | To disable recovery: use "noload" flag, or use "ro,loop" flags, or use "ext2" file system type              |
| Ext4        | File system requires journal recovery   | To disable recovery: use "noload" flag, or use "ro,loop" flags, or use "ext2" file system type              |
| ReiserFS    | File system has unfinished transactions | "nolog" flag does not work (see *man mount*). To disable journal updates: use "ro,loop" flags               |
| XFS         | Always (when unmounting)                | "norecovery" flag does not help (fixed in recent 2.6 kernels). To disable data writes: use "ro,loop" flags. |

Incorrect mount flags can be used to mount file systems on evidentiary
media during the boot process or during the file system preview process.
As described above, this may result in data writes to evidentiary media.
For example, several Ubuntu-based forensic Live CD distributions mount
and recover damaged Ext3/4 file systems on fixed media (e.g. hard
drives) during execution of
[*initrd*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd) scripts (these scripts
mount every supported file system type on every supported media type
using only "-o ro" flag in order to find a root file system image).

List of distributions that recover Ext3 (and sometimes Ext4) file
systems during the boot:

| Distribution                    | Version    |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Helix3                          | 2009R1     |
| SMART Linux (Ubuntu)            | 2010-01-20 |
| FCCU GNU/Linux Forensic Boot CD | 12.1       |
| SPADA                           | 4          |

### Orphan inodes deletion

When mounting Ext3/4 file systems all orphan inodes are removed, even if
"-o ro" mount flag was specified. Currently, there is no specific mount
flag to disable orphan inodes deletion. The only solution here is to use
"-o ro,loop" flags.

### Root file system spoofing

*See also: [early userspace](early_userspace.md)*

Most Ubuntu-based forensic Live CD distributions use Casper (a set of
scripts used to complete initialization process during early stage of
boot). Casper is responsible for searching for a root file system
(typically, an image of live environment) on all supported devices
(because a bootloader does not pass any information about device used
for booting to the kernel), mounting it and executing */sbin/init*
program on a mounted root file system that will continue the boot
process. Unfortunately, Casper was not designed to meet computer
forensics requirements and is responsible for damaged Ext3/4 file
systems recovery during the boot (see above) and root file system
spoofing.

![](Grml.png "Grml.png") mounted root file system from the [hard
drive](hard_drive.md)\]\]

Currently, Casper may select fake root file system image on evidentiary
media (e.g. [HDD](hard_drive.md), because there are no
authenticity checks performed (except optional UUID check for a possible
live file system), and this fake root file system image may be used to
execute malicious code during the boot with root privileges.
Knoppix-based forensic Live CD distributions are vulnerable to the same
attack.

List of Ubuntu-based distributions that allow root file system spoofing:

| Distribution                    | Version    |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Helix3                          | 2009R1     |
| Helix3 Pro                      | 2009R3     |
| CAINE                           | 1.5        |
| Raptor                          | 2.0        |
| BackTrack                       | 4          |
| SMART Linux (Ubuntu)            | 2010-01-20 |
| FCCU GNU/Linux Forensic Boot CD | 12.1       |

Vulnerable Knoppix-based distributions include: SPADA, LinEn Boot CD,
BitFlare.

[Anti-Forensics.Ru project](http://anti-forensics.ru/) [released several
ISO 9660 images](http://digitalcorpora.org/corp/aor/drives/) used to
test various Linux Live CD distributions for root file system spoofing
(description for all images is
[here](http://anti-forensics.ru/casper/)).

### Swap space activation

*Feel free to add information about swap space activation during the
boot in some distributions*

### Incorrect mount policy

#### rebuildfstab and scanpartitions scripts

Several forensic Linux Live CD distributions (Helix3 2009R1, Helix3 Pro
2009R3, old versions of CAINE, old versions of grml) use rebuildfstab
and scanpartition scripts to create entries for attached devices in
*/etc/fstab*. Some versions of these scripts use wrong wildcards while
searching for available block devices (*/dev/?d?* instead of
*/dev/?d\**), this results in missing several "exotic" devices (like
/dev/sdad, /dev/sdad1, etc.) and in data writes when mounting them
(because fstab lacks of read-only mount options for these devices).

### Incorrect write blocking approach

Some forensic Linux Live CD distributions rely on
hdparm and blockdev programs
to mount file systems in read-only mode (by setting the underlying block
device to read-only mode). Unfortunately, setting a block device to
read-only mode does not guarantee that [no write commands will be passed
to the drive](http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2009-07/msg00213.html).
There were several other bugs related to writing on a read-only block
device in the past (like [Ext3/4 orphan inodes
deletion](https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/6/1)). At present (Linux 3.14.2),
kernel code still disregards read-only mode set on block devices in many
places (it should be noted that setting a block device to read-only mode
will efficiently write-protect the drive from programs running in
userspace, while kernel and its modules still can write anything to the
block device, regardless of the read-only mode).

Analysis of the source code for the "write blocking" functionality
utilized by hdparm and
blockdev demonstrates that these tools use the
same system call to alter a kernel flag which is checked in the file
system layer. This flag (when set) disables generic write operations on
a file within a file system and many internal write operations of the
file system layer (like journaling, recovering a file system after a
crash, superblock modifications, etc.). File system drivers use the
interface to the [block device
layer](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/il-AVISHAY/01-block_io-v1.3.pdf)
to perform internal write operations, and the block device layer is
ignoring (not checking) the read-only flag set by hdparm or blockdev on
a block device, therefore it's up to a file system driver to refuse
writing to a block device in read-only mode (and there is nothing
stopping write operations issued by a file system driver not adhering
the read-only mode of a block device due to the lack of read-only flag
checks). [A patch has been
implemented](https://github.com/Schramp/linux-writeblock/wiki) to add
the write blocking functionality to the IO scheduler / block device
layer as well, and make it the default to block all write IO issued to a
read-only block device ([Linux write
blocker](linux_write_blocker.md) does almost the same, except it
doesn't write block anything by default).
