**Full Disk Encryption** or **Whole Disk Encryption** is a phrase that
was coined by Seagate to describe their encrypting
[hard drive](hard_drive.md). Under such a system, the entire
contents of a hard drive are encrypted. This is different from [Full
Volume Encryption](full_volume_encryption.md) where only certain
portions, such as a partition or volume is encrypted.

Some examples of full disk encryption:

## Hardware Solutions

### Embedded into internal HDD

- FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 certification
  issued by NIST)
- FIPS 197 (Federal Information Processing Standard 197 certification
  issued by NIST)
- [AES-128](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/validation-search)

Seagate *Full Disk Encryption* ("FDE")

Seagate's encrypted drives are only available as OEM products. Seagate
provides no software to utilize encrypted drive features (such as key
management). There is a proprietary Windows-only API, but it is not
available to the public.

Toshiba *Self-Encrypting Drives* ("SED")

## Software Solutions

[beCrypt](https://www.becrypt.com/)

[BitLocker](bitlocker_disk_encryption.md)
Part of Windows Vista that uses [AES](aes.md) 128 or 256 bit
encryption

[CGD](cgd.md)
Cryptographic Device Driver. Provides transparent full disk encryption
for [NetBSD](netbsd.md).

Supports various ciphers: [AES](aes.md)
(128 bit blocksize and accepts 128, 192 or 256 bit keys),
[Blowfish](blowfish.md) (64 bit blocksize and accepts 128 bit
keys) and [3DES](3des.md) (uses a 64 bit blocksize and accepts
192 bit keys (only 168 bits are actually used for encryption).

[FreeOTFE](freeotfe.md)
Transparent on the fly encryption for [MS Windows](windows.md)
and [Windows Mobile](microsoft_windows_mobile.md) PDAs. Also
supports mounting [Linux](linux.md)
dm-crypt and
[LUKS](linux_unified_key_setup_(luks).md) volumes

Since data loss can occur on unexpected shutdowns, GELI is recommended
instead of GBDE.

and encryption key with the svnd device. Supports saltfiles. Supported
ciphers: [Blowfish](blowfish.md).

## Full Disk Encryption Analysis Tools

Due to continual updates and variances to full disk encryption software,
there is varied coverage of each software by digital forensics tools.
Additionally, each forensic tool may only support limited versions of
the encryption software, as noted in the table below:
