Encrypted File System (EFS) is the [Cryptographic File
System](file_systems.md#cryptographic-file-systems) that is
build into Microsoft [Windows](windows.md).

[Windows](windows.md) can encrypt files on an EFS volume by
file, by directory, or by the entire volume.
[Encryption](encryption.md) is done using a certificate. The
certificate itself is saved on the encrypted volume, but it is encrypted
with a password. Volumes can be configured so that they can be recovered
using one of several certificates â€” for example, a recovery certificate
belonging to the organization that owns the computer.

# How it works

The first time EFS is used Windows creates a symmetric File Encryption Key
(FEK). Windows then creates an RSA public/private key pair that is used to
encrypt the FEK. The private key is then encrypted with a hash of the user's
passphrase and username. The FEK can also be encrypted with the organization's
public key. Microsoft calls this second key a "Recovery Agent".

In Windows 2000 the computer's administrator is the default recovery agent and
can decrypt all files encrypted with EFS.

In Windows XP and beyond there is no default recovery agent.

EFS can be used in conjunction with [BitLocker](bitlocker_disk_encryption.md)
if desired.

# Recovering an EFS Key

Several tools are available that can recover an EFS key or volume if the
original encryption key (or passphrase) are lost. These include:

* EFS key from Passware;
* Advanced EFS Data Recovery from Elcomsoft
  (http://www.elcomsoft.com/aefsdr.html);
* [EnCase](encase.md) Forensic (can perform a brute-force attack
  on the user's passphrase);
* WinHex Forensic (can also perform a brute-force attack on the user's
  passphrase).

# Linux

It is possible to decrypt files using [ntfsdecrypt](https://github.com/nats/ntfsprogs/blob/master/ntfsprogs/ntfsdecrypt.c)
tool.  In this case, you should get the private key first (by running *cipher
/x filename.pfx* on a [Windows](windows.md) system).
