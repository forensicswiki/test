The following more or less generic computer forensics frameworks exist:

* DELV
* [Open Computer Forensics Architecture (OCFA)](open_computer_forensics_architecture.md)
* [Pyflag](pyflag.md), which has been deprecated
* XIRAF

Further, while not a complete computer forensics frameworks on its own,
[MattockFS](mattockfs.md) is a computer-forensics domain-specific
actor-framework and data-repository system for use in (future) computer
forensics frameworks.
