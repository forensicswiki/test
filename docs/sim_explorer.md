**SIM Explorer** is an advanced SIM card analysis tool designed for
reverse engineers, forensic detectives, or those who are learning about
SIM cards.

SIM Explorer's primary advantage is that it can work with *any type of SIM
card* and show all the files on that card; this includes new card types that
will be released in the future. The software is specifically compatible with
[SIM](sim.md), USIM, [RUIM](ruim.md) and Nextel [iDEN](iden.md) cards and it
will be able to interpret their standard files and show them in a
human-readable form.

## Feature highlights

* A scan mode that can reveal *all* the files on the SIM card, including
  files that are not present on standard cards.
* Displays the *raw data* of each file and record on the SIM, as well as
  the *high-level* (i.e. human readable) interpretation of the raw data.
* Edit the raw data and upload it to the card.
* Provides an *offline analysis* capability that enables you to save a
  SIM card to a file and use that file as if it were the card itself.
  This way SIM card images can be archived or exchanged with colleagues.
* Can *backup and restore* individual files on the SIM as well as the
  entire SIM card.
* Interpret and display a *SIM Toolkit Application*.
* Interpret the ATR of a SIM card.
* Side-by-side SIM card comparison.
* Generate a printable SIM card report.
* Compute the hash of a SIM card (by hashing file contents and file
  properties).
* Supports Unicode SMS

## Requirements

* Any PC/SC compliant [smart card reader](sim_card_forensics.md#hardware).
