This article discusses three approaches for acquiring data from cell phones:
physically removing the flash RAM chips and reading them directly; reading the
data out using the JTAG interface, and running software on the cell phone to
extract the files at a logical level. The authors have built a logical
extraction system and are working on a system based on JTAG.
