This article discusses three approaches for acquiring data from cell
phones: physically removing the flash RAM chips and reading them
directly; reading the data out using the [JTAG](jtag.md)
interface, and running software on the cell phone to extract the files
at a logical level. The authors have built a logical extraction system
and are working on a system based on JTAG.
