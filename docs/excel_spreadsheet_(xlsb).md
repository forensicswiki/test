The **Excel Spreadsheet (XLSB) file format** has the **.xlsb** extension. This
file type originates from [Microsoft Excel](microsoft_excel.md). However, other
spreadsheet software can be used to display these files as well. These include:

* OpenOffice

## MIME types

## File signature

[Microsoft Excel](microsoft_excel.md) spreadsheets of version 2007 are stored
in a [ZIP archive](zip_archive.md) file. These files therefore have the ZIP
file signature
