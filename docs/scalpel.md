**Scalpel** is an open source program for [recovering deleted data](recovering_deleted_data.md)
originally based on [foremost](foremost.md), although significantly more
efficient. Originally developed by [Golden G.  Richard III](golden_g_richard_iii.md)
and presented at the [DFRWS](digital_forensic_research_workshop.md) conference
in 2005, it allows an examiner to specify a number of headers and footers to
recover filetypes from a piece of media. Scalpel is maintained by [Golden G. Richard III](golden_g_richard_iii.md)
and Lodovico Marziale.

Currently, Scalpel is being incorporated into the [The Sleuth Kit](the_sleuth_kit.md)
and is now hosted on GitHub.
