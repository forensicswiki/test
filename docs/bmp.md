The [Windows](windows.md) file format is a lossless image format.

Each file consists of a [header](header.md), an information
block, and then the image data. Note that the image data is given in
order from the *end* of the image file!

## Metadata

In iOS, the [Photo Investigator](photo_investigator.md) can
extract, view, and remove BMP metadata.
