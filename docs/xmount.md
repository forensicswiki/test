Description taken from xmount project site on Pinguin's HQ:

xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and
output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of
the input image.

The virtual representation can be in:

- [raw DD](raw_image_format.md)
- DMG
- [VHD](virtual_hard_disk_(vhd).md)
- [VirtualBox's virtual disk file
  format](virtual_disk_image_(vdi).md)
- [VmWare's VMDK file
  format](vmware_virtual_disk_format_(vmdk).md)

Input images can be:

- [raw DD](raw_image_format.md)
- [EWF (Expert Witness Compression
  Format)](encase_image_file_format.md)
- [Advanced Forensics Format](aff.md)

In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output
files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot
acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.
