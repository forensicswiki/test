David Kovar has been providing IT and software engineering consulting
services for over twenty years. He has also been heavily involved with
domestic and international search and rescue for the last fifteen years.

computer forensics with side trips into executive protection, flying,
riding, emergency services, and some other random things that makes for
a rather … diverse … resume.
