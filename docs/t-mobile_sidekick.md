## History

In June 2006 T-mobile released its third version of the Sidekick, The
Sidekick III.

## Features

The Sidekick is used by many people with hearing disabilities, as it has
a full QWERTY keyboard for text messaging, email, and web browsing. It
is also popular among teenagers for this same reason.

The Sidekick 3 can be customized via [Sidekick
Themes](http://www.sk3-themes.com), which can change the background
image, application icons, and sounds.
