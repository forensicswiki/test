# Net/FSE: Network Forensic Search Engine

Net/FSE is a server application for network operations. The system
consists of a data capture, indexing and search services optimized for
processing high-volume IP-based network log data. Log data from
firewalls, intrusion detection systems, routers and other network
devices is streamed to Net/FSE in near real time, providing network
professionals on enterprise networks with fast drill down and analysis
of billions of log records.

A web interface built on top of Tomcat and GWT is integrated into the
codebase. The UI is designed to be an easy to use workflow tool for
network operations including security, compliance, troubleshooting and
management. Socket-based APIs and HTTP-based XML APIs make integrating
search of network log data fast and easy.

The system is also moving towards a plugin architecture which will allow
users to build custom data processing engines to meet individual needs.
The core system handles capture and storage, as well as search/query
functionality, allowing plugins to easily leverage the system's
capabilities with minimal coding.

# Project Status

In June 2009 version 0.2 of the open source Net/FSE was initially published on
NetFSE.org. The 0.3 release was targeted for August 2010. The project appears
to have been abandoned.
