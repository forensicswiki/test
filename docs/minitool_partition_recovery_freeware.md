## Scanning Range

### Full Disk

Scan entire disk for deleted or lost partitions. This will take a lot of
time.

### Unallocated Space

Scan free space only.

### Specified Range

Scan specific sectors. Recommend to do this when you have in your mind
where the lost/deleted partition is.

## Scanning Modes

### Quick Scan Mode

Quick Scan can restore lost/deleted partitions which are continuous.
When the program find a lost/deleted partition, it will jump to the end
of the partition to continue scanning other lost/deleted partitions.

### Full Scan Mode

Recommended. It takes users more time to perform a "Full Scan" than
"Quick Scan". The effect of full scan is much better than that of a
simple quick scan.
