**Spyware** is software installed physically on the device with the intent to
steal data such as [SMS](sms.md) or location data. This data is collected over
a period of time. The spyware application then sends this data to the person
who installed the spyware to their mobile device or email. Spyware by itself is
legal to use. However, it is illegal to install spyware onto a person's device
without their consent.
