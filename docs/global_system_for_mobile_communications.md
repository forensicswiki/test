The **Global Systems for Mobile Communications** (**GSM**), is a radio-based
technology that allows [mobile phones](mobile_phones.md) to communicate. GSM is
considered to be the world's most ubiquitous radio-based cellular technology,
with 1.7 billion users as of March 2006. In the United States, carriers such as
T-Mobile and Cingular utilize GSM technology for their cellular networks.

# Operational Characteristics

## Network Principles

GSM is considered to be 2G and uses digital data for both signaling and voice
purposes. GSM uses a time division multiple access ([tdma](tdma.md) protocol to
transmit information. Aside from voice, [GPRS](gprs.md) and [EDGE](edge.md)
allow for data transmissions across a GSM network.

## Radio Communication

In terms of frequencies used, GSM networks often use the 900MHz and
1800MHz bands, but carriers in the United States use 850MHz and 1900MHz
bands. As a result, "dual-band" phones, which only support two of the
four major bands, can only be used in certain parts of the world. More
common are "tri-band" phones, which usually operate on 900/1800MHz and
1900MHz. "Quad-band" phones support all four frequencies and can be used
in all parts of the world.

# GSM Forensics

For phones with a SIM card, perform forensics on the cell phone before
removing the [SIM Card](sim_cards.md).
