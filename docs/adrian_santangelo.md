computer forensic experience which started with deep roots in
information and network security. He has been a self-employed computer
security and forensic consultant all his adult life. After starting ISC
Unlimited as a computer security consulting firm in 1996, he quickly
branched out to digital forensics and cyber sleuthing. He has been an
active participant in many online forums and mailing list discussions,
with plenty of information readily available about him with a simple
Google search. (Much of his online security history has been done under
an alias.)

He currently owns and operates Interpreting Technology, an information
technology consulting firm. In Feb 2012, he was sworn in as a Skagit
County Sheriff's Deputy, commissioned for computer crime and forensics.
(He is currently a computer crime and forensic consultant to both law
enforcement and attorneys.) His current career goal is to branch out as
either a law enforcement team leader for digital forensics, focusing on
northwest Washington state, or to continue to be a professional
forensics consultant to the public and private sector. He is well known
locally for his network security and computer repair talents. Currently
held (or close to acquiring) certifications include: MCP, MNE, A+,
