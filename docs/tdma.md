**Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)** is a digital communication
channel allowing many users to access a single communication channel.

## Usage

TDMA is used in the largest available networks in the world. TDMA is
aimed at dealing with multiple access to the same communication medium.
Each individual user is given a unique time slot within the defined
communication channel. This methodology increases the efficiency of
transmission by allowing multiple users simultaneous access to a time
slot. TDMA can be easily adapted to transmission of data as well as
voice communication.

## Features

TDMA offers the ability to carry date rates of 64 kbps to 120 MBPS,
which enables options of communication such as fax, voiceband data, sms,
as well as bandwidth intensive apps. TDMA allows the mobile device to
have extended battery life, since the cellular device is only
transmitting a portion of the time during sessions. In addition, TDMA is
the most cost effective technology for upgrading an analog system to
digital [1](https://www.iec.org/online/tutorials/tdma/topic04.html). TDMA
also enables some vital features for system operation in an advanced
cellular or PCS environment.

## How It Works

Itâ€™s necessary for TDMA to rely upon that fact that the audio signal has
been digitized. These signals are divided into a number of milliseconds
and distributed into time slots. TDMA is also the access technique used
in the European digital cellular standard, GSM, and the Japanese digital
standard, personal digital cellular (PDC). A single channel can carry
all four conversations if each conversation is divided into relatively
short fragments, is assigned a time slot, and is transmitted in
synchronized timed. For instance, if there are four people: Jan, Tom,
Bill, and Bob making calls, each would be assigned a time slot on a
single channel. However, if Bob was no longer using his phone, his time
slot would still be used, wasting bandwidth.
