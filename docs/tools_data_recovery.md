  Record](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US)

## Notes

- "fdisk /mbr" restores the boot code in the [Master boot
  record](master_boot_record.md), but not the partition itself.
  On newer versions of Windows you should use fixmbr, bootrec, mbrfix,
  or [MBRWizard](mbrwizard.md). You can also extract a copy of
  the specific standard MBR code from tools like bootrec.exe and
  diskpart.exe in Windows (from various offsets) and copy it to disk
  with dd (Use bs=446 count=1). For Windows XP SP2
  c:\\%WINDIR%\System32\diskpart.exe the MBR code is found between
  offset 1b818h and 1ba17h.

to create so called 'managed image files' (\*.ibp / \*.ibq) which allow
