Research on disk reliability and disk failure rates is relevant to
computer forensics for several reasons:

- Disk failures frequently make it difficult to recover data from a
  subject computer.
- Because forensic practitioners use very large datasets, issues of disk
  drive reliability can have direct bearing on forensic readyness.
