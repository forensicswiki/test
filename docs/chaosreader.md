## Overview

**Chaosreader** A freeware tool to trace TCP/UDP/... sessions and fetch
application data from snoop or tcpdump logs. This is a type of
"any-snarf" program, as it will fetch telnet sessions, FTP files, HTTP
transfers (HTML, GIF, JPEG, ...), SMTP emails, ... from the captured
data inside network traffic logs. A html index file is created that
links to all the session details, including realtime replay programs for
telnet, rlogin, IRC, X11 and VNC sessions; and reports such as image
reports and HTTP GET/POST content reports. Chaosreader can also run in
standalone mode - where it invokes tcpdump or snoop (if they are
available) to create the log files and then processes them.
