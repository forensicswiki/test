Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic
programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of
code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The
language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a
small and large scale.

In digital forensics, Python is slowly replacing Perl as the de facto
language for short, single purpose written code. Scripts written in
Python can often function on both Windows and \*nix operating systems
with no or minor modifications.

There are several [FOSS](free_and_open-source_software.md) and
commercial implementation of Python interpreters.
