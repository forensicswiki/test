Incident Response is a set of procedures for an investigator to examine
a computer security incident. This process involves figuring out what
was happened and preserving information related to those events. Because
of the fluid nature of computer investigations, incident response is
more of an art than a science.

## Tools

Incident response tools can be grouped into three categories. The first
category is **Individual Tools**. These are programs designed to probe
parts of the operating system and gather useful and/or volatile data.
The tools are self-contained, useful, discrete, and do not create a
large footprint on the victim system.

Standalone tools have been combined to create **Script Based Tools**.
These tools combine a number of standalone tools that are run via a
script or batch file. They require minimal interaction from the user and
gather a fixed set of data. These tools are good in that they automate
the incident response process and provide the examiner with a standard
process to defend in court. They also do not require the first responder
to necessarily be an expert with the individual tools. Their weakness,
however, is that they can be inflexible. Once the order of the tools is
set, it can be difficult to change. Some script based tools allow the
user to pick and choose which standalone tools will be used in a given
examination.

The final category of tools are **Agent Based Tools**. These tools
require the examiner to install a program on the victim which can then
report back to a central server. The upshot is that one examiner can
install the program on multiple computers, gather data from all of them,
and then view the results in the aggregate. Finding the victim or
victims can be easier if they stand out from the crowd.

## Books

There are several books available that discuss incident response. For
[Windows](windows.md), *[Windows Forensics and Incident
Recovery](https://www.windows-ir.com/)* by [Harlan
Carvey](harlan_carvey.md) is an excellent introduction to
possible scenarios and how to respond to them.
