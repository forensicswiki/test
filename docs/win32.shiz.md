*Win32.Shiz* (other name: *Trojan.PWS.Ibank*) is a malicious program
designed for online banking fraud.

Current versions of this program support almost all online banking
systems in Russian Federation (BS-Client, Sberbank, etc) as well as many
online poker clients.

The program can be used to steal usernames and passwords used to access
online banking system, cryptographic keys stored as files (e. g. on USB
Flash drives or hard disk drives), URLs used to access online banking
system and certificates stored in web-browsers. If online banking system
uses access control lists based on IP addresses then Win32.Shiz can set
up a SOCKS proxy-server on a compromised computer.
