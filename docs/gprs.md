**General Packet Radio Services (GPRS)** is a wireless data
communication service that transfers data at a rate of up to 40-50Kbps,
a similar access speed to a dial-up modem.

It permits continuous connection to the Internet for [mobile phones](mobile_phone.md)
and higher data rates allow for the use of multimedia applications such as
websites viewing on mobile handheld devices. Other features provided through
the use of GPRS are e-mail, video streaming, multimedia messages and
location-based services. GPRS is based on Global System for Mobile
communication, which runs at speeds of up to 9.6 kilobits, and is available on
almost all GSM networks.

GPRS is an efficient way of sending and receiving small bursts of data,
such as e-mail and web browsing, in addition to receiving large volumes
of data.

**EGPRS** (**Enhanced GPRS** or **EDGE**) is an enhanced version of GPRS
and uses a different type of technology. It allows GPRS transfers of
approximately three times faster.

## Capabilities Available With GPRS

GPRS provides the ability to make use many different mobile services and
capabilities, for example e-mail, web browsing, games, calendar
funcionality, using the cell phone as modem for laptops. instant messaging
and lots more.

GPRS](https://www.nokia.com/).

## GPRS Classes

There are three GPRS classes which help indicate the capabilities of a
[mobile phone](mobile_phone.md).

**Class A**
Mobile phones of this class can be connected to both GPRS and
[GSM](gsm.md) services simultaneously.

**Class B**
Mobile phones of this class can be attached to both GPRS and GSM
services, but using only one service at a time. Switching between them
(suspend/resume) is done automatically.

**Class C**
Mobile phones of this class are attached to either GPRS or GSM voice
service. One needs to switch manually between services.

## Comparison of Technologies

The class of the device determines the speed at which GPRS can be used.
The table below displays different types of technologies and their rates
of transfer.

| Type          | Uplink (Send) | Downlink (Receive) |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| GPRS          | 14 kbps       | 28-64 kbps         |
| GSM CSD       | 9.6-14 kbps   | 9.6-14 kbps        |
| Dial-UP       | 56 kbps       | 56 kbps            |
| ISDN Standard | 64 kbps       | 64 kbps            |
| Broadband     | 2 Mbps        | 2 Mbps             |
