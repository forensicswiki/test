## Summary

A prerequisite for the use of [SIMIS](simis.md), is that the SIM card must be
functional. A physically damaged, broken or dirty SIM may not function
correctly, resulting in the recovery of corrupted data, or no data at all. In
the forensic data recovery environment, SIM's will be presented in a variety of
different conditions, ranging from good, but lightly soiled, through blood
soaked to physically broken. Lightly soiled and blood soaked SIM's may be
cleaned using appropriate methods, ensuring that the SIM is not further damaged
taking care to preserve surface printing where possible.

However, physically damaged or broken SIM's require more specialised
processing to produce a viable SIM for data recovery purposes. Crownhill
has extensive experience in the area of SIM data recovery through its
activity in the SIM manufacturing process. Crownhill works directly with
the SIM silicon manufacturers and SIM card manufacturers. Processes
developed to aid fault analysis and qualitative measurements are an
invaluable advantage when attempting to repair and recover data from
physically damaged SIM modules.

Crownhill have invested in purpose-built laboratory facilities to
provide professional card cleaning, data recovery and card repair
service. Based in discrete, secure premises, Crownhill can provide the
full compliment of services required to clean, repair and recover data
from damaged SIM's. Drawing on its own expertise and relationships with
Card manufacturers and silicon vendors world-wide, Crownhill have
created a centre of excellence for this specialised work. An overview of
the procedures can be found here

Where a SIM is thought to be functional, Crownhill can provide a SIM
cleaning service. Blood, soot, general soiling and body fluids are
handled in an environmentally secure fashion, relieving the client of
responsibility for Bio Hazards and other Health and Safety issues.
Cleaned SIM's are returned without undue delay, ready for data recovery
by the client. Cleaning by Crownhill must be carried out after the SIM
has been pre-processed for any physical evidence required, such as
Photography and DNA sampling. Data Recovery Process

## Data Recovery Process

If our findings suggest that data recovery is likely to be possible, the
SIM may further examined by real time X-ray, to determine the extent of
the damage. Specifically we will be looking for broken or damaged wire
bonds, detachment of the silicon die and possible fractures of the die.

### Decapsulation

Where a damaged bond wire(s) is clearly identified and if there is no
obvious damage to the silicon die, the die encapsulation can be removed.
The de-capsulation process requires a great deal of skill and the use of
proprietary mixes of aggressive solvents and/or acids. The exact process
used depends upon the.

### Testing

After de-capsulation, further electrical tests are carried out to
confirm the viability of the recovered silicon die. The die bonding pads
are then probed and once electrical connection is established, the
silicon is accessed and the sim data recovered using proprietary
software.

### X-Rays

Real time X-ray examination is used to confirm the conclusions drawn
from the preceding Physical, Optical and Electrical tests. X-ray
examination is only undertaken where the integrity of the silicon die is
thought to be uncompromised.
