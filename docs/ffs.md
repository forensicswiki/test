**FFS** is one name given to the BSD **Fast File System**, also known as
**UFS1** or **UFS2** (referring to different versions of the file
system). Modern FFS implementations are used in many systems based on
4.2BSD, 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD, including [FreeBSD](freebsd.md),
[OpenBSD](openbsd.md), and [NetBSD](netbsd.md). Variants
and derivative file systems are also in use on other platforms,
including [Solaris](solaris.md). Many differences in terms of
capabilities and metadata exist between these systems, and compatibility
is not guaranteed.
