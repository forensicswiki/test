Tools libraries and frameworks built by or for goverment agencies often,
although essentialy being "open source", can not be freely shared and
redistributed.

In the most strict cases an [NDA](nda.md) is used, but in some
cases instead of this a **scoped distribution** is defined. With scoped
distribution it is allowed to (re)distribute the product, but only under
the conditions mentioned by the scope. An often used scope for forensic
tools is the Law Enforcement (LEA) only scope.
