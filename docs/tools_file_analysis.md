## Software Forensics

[CodeSuite](codesuite.md) by Software Analysis & Forensic Engineering
CodeSuite comprises BitMatch, CodeCross, CodeDiff, CodeMatch, and
SourceDetective for comparing and analyzing source code and object code
to find copyright infringement and trade secret theft. It can be used
for free on small sets of code.

CodeSuite also includes FileCount and FileIsolate for counting file
attributes and quickly copying or deleting entire file trees. Both are
free utilities.

## Open Source Tools

[file](file.md)
The file command determines the file type of a given file, depending on
its contents and not on e.g. its extension or filename. In order to do
that, it uses a magic configuration file that identifies filetypes.

<!-- -->

[ldd](ldd.md)
List dynamic dependencies of executable files.

<!-- -->

[truss](truss.md)
Solaris tool used to trace the system/library calls (not user calls) and
signals made/received by a new or existing process. It sends the output
to stderr.

<http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2239/truss-1?l=en&a=view&q=truss>

<!-- -->

[PDF Miner](pdf_miner.md)
"...suite of programs that aims to help analyzing text data from PDF
documents. It includes a PDF parser, a PDF renderer (though only
rendering text is supported for now), and a couple of nice tools to
extract texts. Unlike other PDF-related tools, it allows to obtain the
exact location of texts in a page, as well as other layout information
such as font size or font name, which could be useful for analyzing the
document. It also infers text running within a page by using clustering
technique."

<!-- -->

[xtrace](xtrace.md)
eXtended trace utility, similar to strace, ptrace, truss, but with
extended functionality and unique features, such as dumping function
calls (dynamically or statically linked), dumping call stack and more.

[Valgrind](valgrind.md)
Executes a program under emulation, performing analysis according to one
of the many plug-in modules as desired. You can write your own plug-in
module as desired.

<http://valgrind.org/>

<!-- -->

[DTrace](dtrace.md)
Comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for Solaris (also ported to
MacOS X - XRays and FreeBSD). DTrace provides a powerful infrastructure
to permit investigation of the behavior of the operating system and user
programs.

<!-- -->

[strings](strings.md)
Strings will print the strings of printable characters in files. It
allows choosing different charactersets (ASCII, UNICODE). It is a quick
way to browse through files/partitions/... in order to look for words,
filenames, keywords etc.
