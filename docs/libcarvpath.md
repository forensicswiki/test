LibCarvPath is a library designed to be used by carving and file system
analysis tools. LibCarvPath allows fragments represented by offset and size to
be combined in a CarvPath annotation that take the form of file system paths.
LibCarvPath addresses the limits of file system paths by mapping extremely
fragmented files to a uniquely identifying key in a long-path database.

The following tools use LibCarvPath and/or CarvPath Annotations:

* [CarvFs](carvfs.md)
* [tsk-cp](tsk-cp.md)
* [scalpelcp](scalpelcp.md)
* Modules for the [Open Computer Forensics Architecture](open_computer_forensics_architecture.md)
  that use the [OCFA treegraph API](ocfa_treegraph_api.md).

Next to these, in Photorec work has started to include LibCarvPath support.
