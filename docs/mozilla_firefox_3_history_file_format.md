Starting in Firefox 3, a new file format is used to record browser
history information. Rather than storing this information in a flat file
using the mork file format, the information is kept in a SQLite
database.

## File Locations

**Windows XP**

C:\Documents and Settings\\<username>\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\\<profile folder>\places.sqlite

**Windows Vista**

C:\Users\\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\\<profile folder>\places.sqlite

**GNU/Linux**

/home/<user>/.mozilla/firefox/<profile folder>/places.sqlite

**Mac OS X**

/Users/<user>/Library/Application
Support/Firefox/Profiles/default.lov/places.sqlite

## File Header

Firefox 3 history files start with

     53 51 4C 69 74 65 20 66 6F 72 6D 61 74 20 33

which represents the ascii string SQLite format 3. This is normal for
any Sqlite database file, so it may be more appropriate to verify that
the file is a Firefox 3 history file by looking for the database tables
within the file. For example, at offset 120701 (0x1D77D) the hex value

    43 52 45 41 54 45 20 54 41 42 4C 45 20 6D 6F 7A 5F 62 6F 6F 6B 6D 61 72 6B 73

can be found. This represents the ascii string CREATE TABLE
moz_bookmarks. At offset 120973 (0x1D88D) the hex value

    43 52 45 41 54 45 20 49 4E 44 45 58 20 6D 6F 7A 5F 62 6F 6F 6B 6D 61 72 6B 73 5F 69 74 65 6D 69 6E 64 65 78

can be found. This represents the ascii string CREATE TABLE
moz_bookmarks_itemindex.

## Database Tables

The places.sqlite file is essentially a database with multiple tables:

    moz_anno_attributes
    moz_annos
    moz_bookmarks
    moz_bookmarks_roots
    moz_favicons
    moz_historyvisits
    moz_inputhistory
    moz_items_annos
    moz_keywords
    moz_places

## moz_places

The moz_places table holds some of the information necessary to
reconstruct the browser history.

      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      url LONGVARCHAR (The whole URL string)
      title LONGVARCHAR (The title presented from the TITLE tags on the page)
      rev_host LONGVARCHAR (this is the host name from the URL in reverse)
      visit_count INTEGER
      hidden INTEGER
      typed INTEGER
      favicon_id INTEGER
      frecency INTEGER

## moz_historyvisits

The moz_historyvisits table holds the other information that you need to
link up with moz_places to reconstruct the browser history.

      id INTEGER
      from_visit INTEGER
      place_id INTEGER
      visit_date INTEGER
      visit_type INTEGER
      session INTEGER

The place_id column of the moz_historyvisits table corresponds to the id
column of the moz_places table.

The visit_date column keeps time in
[PRTime](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/PRTime) format, a 64-bit
integer representing the number of microseconds since midnight
(00:00:00) 1 January 1970 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This level
of precision may be more than what is required for a forensic
application, but the PRTime format can easily be converted into CTime
format by dividing by 1,000,000. The
[datetime](https://www.sqlite.org/index.htmllang_datefunc.html) function in SQLite
can be used to convert CTime to human readable format, as demonstrated
in the example below.

The visit_type column is an integer that represents one of seven types.

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>

1

</td>
<td>

TRANSITION_LINK

</td>
<td>

This transition type means the user followed a link and got a new
toplevel window.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

2

</td>
<td>

TRANSITION_TYPED

</td>
<td>

This transition type means that the user typed the page's URL in the URL
bar or selected it from URL bar autocomplete results, clicked on it from
a history query (from the History sidebar, History menu, or history
query in the personal toolbar or Places organizer.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

3

</td>
<td>

TRANSITION_BOOKMARK

</td>
<td>

This transition is set when the user followed a bookmark to get to the
page.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

4

</td>
<td>

TRANSITION_EMBED

</td>
<td>

This transition type is set when some inner content is loaded. This is
true of all images on a page, and the contents of the iframe. It is also
true of any content in a frame, regardless of whether or not the user
clicked something to get there.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

5

</td>
<td>

TRANSITION_REDIRECT_PERMANENT

</td>
<td>

Set when the transition was a permanent redirect.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

TRANSITION_REDIRECT_TEMPORARY

Set when the transition was a temporary redirect.

TRANSITION_DOWNLOAD

</td>

Set when the transition is a download.

## Gathering browser history

Live browser history for Firefox 3 can be gathered by connecting to the
Sqlite database and performing simple queries. For example, the URLs
visited and the date and time of the visit can be gathered with this
query:

    SELECT datetime(moz_historyvisits.visit_date/1000000,'unixepoch'), moz_places.url
    FROM moz_places, moz_historyvisits
    WHERE moz_places.id = moz_historyvisits.place_id
