##

WetStone has created this one-day advanced module to their Hacking
Bootcamp focusing exclusively on Zombies and Botnets. Students will have
unique access to our “hands-on” interactive learning environment.
Students will work together to establish a complex Botnet environment
and practice investigative methods/techniques to collect criminal
information. Each student will learn how to shutdown and isolate Botnet
operators and individual Zombies in order to limit or preempt the damage
they can cause.

**Sinister Cyber Weapons**

One of the most sinister cyber weapons to arrive on the scene in recent
years are Zombies and their associated Botnets.

Today's cyber investigators must possess in depth working knowledge of
their internals. To accomplish this you must know how to setup,
investigate, and shutdown these weapons.

Botnets are continuing to be a global issue. These types of malicious
software are penetrating our personal, corporate and government systems.
Statistics are showing that up to one quarter of all computers that are
connected to the internet have become a part of a Botnet.
