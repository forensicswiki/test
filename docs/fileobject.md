**fileobject** is a [Digital Forensics XML](digital_forensics_xml_schema.md) tag
which is used to describe information about a file.

The file object can contain information about:

- The file's name
- The file's hash code(s)
- The file's location on the disk.
- Embedded metadata
- Block hashes, a Bloom Filter, or a Similarity Digest for the file.

Other objects can be embedded in a **fileobject** object:

- The **byte_runs** object specifies where the file is located on the
  disk.
- A **sector_hash** object is a list of sector hash codes.
- The sector_hash object could contain a **nsrl_bloom** object, which
  would be a bloom filter that contains all of the sector hashes.
