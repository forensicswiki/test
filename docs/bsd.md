**Berkeley Software Distribution** (**BSD**) is one of the three major
derivates of the [Unix](unix.md) [operating
system](operating_system.md) from which many versions have been
created such as [OpenBSD](openbsd.md),
[FreeBSD](freebsd.md), [NetBSD](netbsd.md), [Trusted BSD](trusted_bsd.md), and very early versions of
[Sun](sun.md)â€™s [Solaris](solaris.md). BSD was first
released in the late 1970s and continues to have a strong following
today exhibited in the continued existence of the above versions. The
only exception is Sun who switched the design of their operating system
over to [System V](system_v.md) Release 4.
