**Berkeley Software Distribution** (**BSD**) is one of the three major
derivates of the [Unix](unix.md) [operating system](operating_system.md) from
which many versions have been created such as [OpenBSD](openbsd.md),
[FreeBSD](freebsd.md), [NetBSD](netbsd.md), Trusted BSD, and very early
versions of [Sun Microsystems](sun_microsystems_inc.md)â€™ [Solaris](solaris.md).
BSD was first released in the late 1970s and continues to have a strong
following today exhibited in the continued existence of the above versions. The
only exception is Sun who switched the design of their operating system over to
System V Release 4.
