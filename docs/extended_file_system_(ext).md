The Extended File System (Ext) is a family of file systems consisting
of: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4

## Ext2

**ext2** or the **second extended file system** is a [Linux](linux.md)
file system designed as a replacement for ext.

## Ext3

**ext3** or the **third extended file system** is a [Linux](linux.md)
file system. Its main advantage over ext2 is journalling which improves
reliability and eliminates the need to check the file system after an unclean
shutdown.

Note that ext3 is mostly compatible with ext2.

## Ext4

**ext4** or the **fourth extended file system** is a [Linux](linux.md)
file system.
