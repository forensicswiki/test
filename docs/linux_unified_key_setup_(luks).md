Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) is commonly used by Linux to encrypt
storage media volumes. LUKS is implemented in the Linux kernel in
dm-crypt (dm = Device Mapper) and the user-space component cryptsetup.

LUKS supports various encryption methods, like:

* [Alleged RC4 (arc4)](rc4.md)
* [AES](aes.md)
* Anubis
* [BlowFish](blowfish.md)
* Cast5
* Cast6
* [Serpent](serpent.md)
* Tnepres a reversed variant of [Serpent](serpent.md)
* [TwoFish](twofish.md)

These encryption methods can be used in various chaining modes and with
various initialization vector modes.

## How to detect

A LUKS encrypted volume starts with the "LUKS\xba\xbe" signature.

A hexdump of the start of the volume should look similar to:

    00000000  4c 55 4b 53 ba be 00 01  61 65 73 00 00 00 00 00  |LUKS....aes.....|
    00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
    00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  63 62 63 2d 65 73 73 69  |........cbc-essi|
    00000030  76 3a 73 68 61 32 35 36  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |v:sha256........|
    00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  72 69 70 65 6d 64 31 36  |........ripemd16|
    00000050  30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |0...............|

The encryption method in the example is:

    aes

The encryption mode is in the format:

    chaining_mode[-initialization_vector_mode[:initialization_vector_options]]

Which in the example is:

    cbc-essiv:sha256

And the password hashing method in the example is:

    ripemd160

## How to decrypt

`sudo cryptsetup luksOpen `<device>` `<name>

Provide the passphrase when prompted. The <name> will be created as a
device mapper entry (i.e. /dev/mapper/thename) and this device will
expose the filesystem.

## Dump the header information of a LUKS device

`sudo cryptsetup luksDump `<device>

See the cryptsetup(8) man page for other operations.
