Kristinn Guðjónsson used to be a team
leader of information security at Skyggnir/TM Software/TM Infrastructure
Management/Nyherji (same company, many different names), one of
Iceland's largest hosting providers, before joining Google to be part of
their IR team.

Kristinn holds a M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from INT (Institut
National des Telecommunications) in Paris as well as a B.Sc. degree in
electrical and computer engineering from the University of Iceland.

There is a blog out there
[blog.kiddaland.net](http://blog.kiddaland.net) that is mostly not
updated, and occasional blog posts on the SANS Forensics blog.

He also likes to maintain his small open-source tool,
[log2timeline](log2timeline.md), a framework for extracting
timestamps from various files.
