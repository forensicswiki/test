This article is intended to give a high-level overview of analyzing
program execution on the various operating systems. A typical operating
system has direct and indirect program executions indicators.

- direct indicators; these are artifacts of sub systems related to
  "executing" a program on the operating system, e.g. a Prefetch file.
- indirect indicators; these are artifacts that the program itself has
  left while running, e.g. a MRU Registry key.

This article focuses on the direct program execution indicators.

will vary per product.
