The **Digital Forensic Research Workshop** (**DFRWS**) was initiated in
August 2001 to bring academic researchers and digital forensic
[investigators](investigator.md) and practitioners together for
active discussion that addresses three major objectives:

* Define the need and create the processes for the incorporation of a
  rigorous scientific method as a fundamental tenant of the evolving
  discipline of Digital Forensic Science.
* Develop a research agenda that considers practitioner requirements,
  multiple investigative environments and emphasizes real world
  usability.
* The discovery, explanation and presentation of conclusive, persuasive
  evidence that will meet the heightened scrutiny of the courts and
  other decision-makers in military and civilian environments.

Since 2001, an annual workshop has been held in various cities around
the US to present and discuss research topics. Archives are available as
well as a more detailed history.
