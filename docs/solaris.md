**Solaris** is a highly scalable enterprise grade [UNIX](unix.md) Operating
System from [Sun Microsystems](sun_microsystems_inc.md). Solaris is known to run on
[SPARC](sparc.md) and x86/x86-64 architectures, although it has also been
ported to [PowerPC](powerpc.md) and IBM [zSeries](zseries.md)
[mainframes](mainframes.md) in a joint effort with [IBM](ibm.md).

Commonly used filesystems and / or volume managers on the Solaris
Operating System are:

* AVS
* QFS
* SAMFS
* Solaris Volume Manager (solstice)
* UFS
* Veritas VxFS and Veritas VxVM
* [ZFS](zfs.md)
