**hashdb** is a tool for finding previously identified blocks of data in
media such as disk images. **hashdb** provides the following:

- The **hashdb** tool used to create hash databases, import block
  hashes, provide lookup services, and otherwise manage block hash
  databases.
- The **hashdb** library that allows other programs to create hash
  databases or scan for block hashes. The **hashid** scanner is a
  **bulk_extractor** plugin that uses **libhashdb** to search for
  previously identified blocks of data.
