- NASA OIG has generously allowed us to publish their policy for the
  preservation and analysis of digital evidence by computer forensic
  specialists and special agents. In their words, "It's our hope that
  this document will help others, particularly law enforcement
  organizations, with policy development in this growing area of
  importance. We also hope that others will consider sharing portions of
  their policy and procedures as they are developed and continuously
  refined."
