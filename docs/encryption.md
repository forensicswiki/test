**Encryption** is a means to obfuscate data an entity wishes to protect
to the point it will take a third party considerable time to access
(decrypt) it. The methods of encryption vary from substitution ciphers
to more modern methods such as digital ciphers which use an algorithm to
obfuscate the data. Once the data is encrypted it is then referred to as
cipher text.
