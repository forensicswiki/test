The **IXimager** imager application is external to the
[Windows](windows.md) [operating
systems](operating_system.md).

It is based on [Linux](linux.md) and is used in conjunction with
[ILook Investigator](ilook.md) to perform the specific tasks. The program can
use one of three proprietary file formats.

Use of **IXimager** is restricted to members of federal/state/local law
enforcement or certain government agencies. The ILook analysis tool,
which includes the IXimager, is available free of charge to these
individuals.
