Strings is a program that prints out any [ASCII](ascii.md) or Unicode strings
in the input file. Forensic examiners can use strings to get a sense of the
functionality of an unknown program. User prompts, error messages, and status
messages can give hints, but should not be used as proof or lack or any
functionality.

Most [Linux](linux.md) distributions and other UNIX-like operating systems have
a strings program included.

There is a [Windows](windows.md) version of strings by [Mark Russinovich](mark_russinovich.md).
Note that the Windows version prints an output header and searches for both
ASCII and Unicode strings by default.
