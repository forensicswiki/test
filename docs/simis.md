SIMIS is a range of products developed for forensic examination of GSM
SIM Cards.

## SIMIS 2G

**Feature Overview**

- Forensically safe - no facility for the modification of system or user
  data held on the SIM
- Correctly handles PIN and PUK entry under controlled conditions.
- Builds a database with unique file references for each SIM Card.
- Searchable database with appropriate index categories.
- Facility to read data from the SIMIS Mobile card interrogation unit.
- Presents data in a printable format for reports.
- Provides commented RAW data in a standard format for use in third
  party applications.

**Typically a SIMIS package consists of:**

- PC based software application
- PC/SC Smart Card Reader (USB or Serial)
- Mini-Sim Adapter
- USB License Key

There is also the option to use a PC Card (PCMCIA) Reader for laptops
and notebooks.

**The Search Engine**

The SIMIS database search engine, allows comprehensive searches to be
made across all SIM cards data that have been interrogated. Searches can
be carried out across the entire database, or can be narrowed down to
things like a specific case reference, or a specific mobile number.

A typical search would allow you to enter a mobile phone number and
identify if that number was held in the ADN of any card previously
interrogated - potentially opening up new lines of inquiry in
investigations, or linking suspected criminals and networks together.

## SIMIS 3G

SIMIS 3G provides the examiner with broadly similar features and
facilities to SIMIS 2, however the 3G 'SIM' holds a vast amount of user
and network information. SIMIS 3G is a most comprehensive tool for the
recovery and clear precise presentation of the data.

SIMIS 3G presents the recovered data in its original language (Unicode
fully supported), in an easily browsable format, complete with
comprehensive print facilities and selectable scan depth. SIMIS 3G
allows the examiner to view recovered data (including phone book
contacts and numbers, SMS text messages, deleted text messages, time and
date information and more )

SIMIS3G provides access to all areas of the USIM, however SIMIS3G was
designed to be intuitive and easy to use, requiring no detailed
knowledge of the USIM operating system. SIMIS3G will generate human
readable clear concise reports for each USIM interrogation, with
optional additional user entered information such as, operator name,
case ID, exhibit number, Handset type etc.

Recovered data is secured against tampering using both MD5 and SHA-1
hashing techniques. Recovered data, reports and hashing codes are stored
locally in unique folders to ensure integrity of data and ease of
access.

Dual SIMIS 2 and SIMIS3G licensing with Auto Detect of card format
allows the user to harvest data in a clean simple environment with
robust powerful tools, configured for everyday use.

SIMIS 3G has been evaluated tested and used by leading mobile
intelligence examiners and forensic experts. Meeting or exceeding their
every needs.

**SIMIS 3G is comprised of:**

- USB card readers (PCSC Industry standard)
- PC software on CDROM
- mini sim adapter and USIM storage card
- license

## SIMIS Mobile

The SIMIS Mobile reader allows SIM cards to be read whilst away from the
SIMIS software installation. The SIMIS Mobile can read and store the
essential contents of up to 8 SIM cards. The SIM card data can viewed
via the large 128X64 graphicSIMIS mobile is a small handheld device
display, then transferred to True GSM specification cards, creating a
'clone' of the original as a backup for reading in any SIM reading
application at a later date. Transfer cards can be erased and re-used
and additional transfer cards are available as required. The mobile unit
is palm size, powered by 2 AAA cells, and supplied with 8 data transfer
cards (data storage cards). The 64x128 pixel LCD displays an intuitive
menu to guide the user through reading, browsing and saving recovered
data. Work in the field or covert operation is aided by simple three
button operation (excluding PIN entry and on/off). PIN and PUK entry are
catered for.

**The browser function allows viewing of:**

- ICC and IMSI
- ADN
- FDN
- LDN
- SDN
- MSISDN
- SMS
- SMSP

**The SIMIS Mobile package includes:**

- Small hand-held card reader for use in the field
- 8 x Data Transfer cards (enabling SIM cloning)
- Batteries

## SIMIS Engine

The knowledge required to read and understand the data within a SIM or
USIM takes time to accumulate and even more time to then understand and
interpret the recovered data. Some end users and companies wishing to
enter the market don't have the required knowledge or experience to
accurately recover all the data from a SIM or USIM.

The SIMIS engine can be licensed to facilitate the development of
independent SIM interrogation products. No restrictions are imposed on
the use of the engine or the sale of any product that may compete with
our own. Regular updates are made to the SIMIS engine and provide the
licensee with updates as required.
