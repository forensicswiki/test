## Court Decisions

**United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010)**
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government must have a
search warrant before it can seize and search emails held by email
service providers. "Given the fundamental similarities between email and
traditional forms of communication \[like postal mail and telephone
calls\], it would defy common sense to afford emails lesser Fourth
Amendment protection..."

**Binary Semantics Ltd. v. Minitab, Inc., Case No. 07‐1750 (M.D. Pa. May
5, 2008)**
In 2008, a district court agreed that a forensic image of an entire FTP
server was "overly‐broad and intrusive,” allowing the defendants only
authorization for “a forensic copy of the relevant folders on \[the\]
FTP server."

**Harkabi v. Sandisk Corp., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87843 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.
23, 2010)**
Electronic discovery requires litigants to scour disparate data storage
mediums and formats for potentially relevant documents. That undertaking
involves dueling considerations: thoroughness and cost.

**United States v. Scott‐Emuakpor, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3118 (W.D.
Mich. 2000)**
The court was satisfied with a third‐party collecting the forensic data
as long as it was accompanied by "the testimony of a witness who was
present and observed the procedure by which the documents were obtained
from Defendant's computers."

**Griffin v. State, 2010 Md. App. LEXIS 87 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. May 27,
2010)**
Social media profiles on MySpace or Facebook could be authenticated
circumstantially by their content and context in the same manner as
other forms of electronic communications.

**State v. Rivas, 2007 Ohio App. LEXIS 3299 (Ohio Ct. App. Jul. 13,
2007)**
The court overturned the conviction of the defendant due to the fact
that an *[in camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_camera)* review of
the police department's computer was not performed, which would have
verified that accuracy of the transcripts that were recorded from a chat
room and subsequently used against the defendant.

**Fenje v. Feld, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24387 (N.D. Ill., Dec. 8,
2003)**
The authentication of email messages presented in support of a summary
judgement motion was at the core of this wrongful termination case. The
court found that email messages may be authenticated as being from the
suspected author based on the following factors:

- The email address from which it was sent
- An affidavit of the recipient
- Comparison of the content of the email with other evidence
- Other communication from the suspected author acknowledging the email
  message in question

**U.S. v. Cameron, 2010 WL 3238326 (U.S. District Court for the District
of Maine 2010)** (on-going)
Yahoo! detected child pornography and reported it to the NCMEC, and
Cameron expected the Government to produce as witnesses the Yahoo!
technician who collected the evidence. The judge noted that at trial the
"Government need not call each of the technicians who did the search so
long as it" presented a witness who can "explain and be cross-examined
concerning the manner in which the records are made and kept." Further,
the Judge ordered that the Government is not obligated to turn over
evidence that it does not possess (e.g. "the original or a copy of the
Yahoo! photo server and server files" or "the physical location of the
original server files")

**Krumwiede v. Brighton Associates, LLC, 2006 WL 1308629 (N.D. Ill. May
8, 2006)** Default judgment granted for deleting, altering and accessing
electronic data despite litigation hold. Plaintiff deleted file with a
combination of "deliberate movement of file data, admitted deletion
activities, multiple use of defrag, use of ZIP file to conceal or
transport \[the defendants'\] data, \[and use of\] multiple USB devices
\[to\] intend to destroy evidence." Summary judgment against plaintiff
for interfering with the discovery process.
