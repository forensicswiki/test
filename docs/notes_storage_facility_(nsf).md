## Contents

The NSF basically is a collection of **Notes**. A **Note** in concept is
similar to that of an object or item; mainly a container for data and
metadata. **Notes** are used to store a vast variety of items, e.g.
emails, documents, appointments, log-entries, data-views, forms, etc.

## Encryption

Notes can use various forms of encryption see: [Notes from Support:
Notes Encryption - Locks for a Digital
World](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-Notes_Encryption/index.html).
