Right now this is just a list of resources that will be useful for
people doing forensic data mining and machine learning.

## Open Source Software

* [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) data mining toolkit -
  java, has programmatic and GUI interface.
* Ping He has created an [Open Source C4.5 implementation in C](https://code.google.com/archive/p/fc45)
* [Machine Learning Open Source Software](https://mloss.org) - a page
  hosting many open source machine learning tools and libraries.
* [Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org//): goal is to "build
  scalable, Apache licensed machine learning libraries" (java). also
  includes a focus on using [hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/).
* The [Journal of Machine Learning](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/)
  maintains an [archive of non-trivial machine learning algorithms, toolboxes, and languages](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/mloss/).
