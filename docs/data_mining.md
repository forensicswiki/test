Right now this is just a list of resources that will be useful for
people doing forensic data mining and machine learning.

## Open Source Software

- [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) data mining toolkit -
  java, has programmatic and GUI interface.
- Ping He has created an [Open Source C4.5 implementation in
  C](https://code.google.com/archive/p/fc45)
- [Machine Learning Open Source Software](http://mloss.org) - a page
  hosting many open source machine learning tools and libraries.
- [Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org//): goal is to "build
  scalable, Apache licensed machine learning libraries" (java). also
  includes a focus on using [hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/core/).
- The [Journal of Machine Learning](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/)
  maintains an [archive of non-trivial machine learning algorithms,
  toolboxes, and languages](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/mloss/).
