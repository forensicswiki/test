**Masterkey Linux** (or simply Masterkey) is a [Live CD](live_cd.md) based on
Slackware developed by Dr. Qin Zhou of Coventry University. It focuses on
[incident response](incident_response.md) and [computer forensics](computer_forensics.md).

Whilst designed for use by students entering the field of Computer
Forensics, Masterkey contains a diverse range of free and open source
tools that both students, computer forensics professionals and system
administrators alike can use.

## Tools Included

In addition to standard unix/linux tools, a suite of editors, office
applications and multimedia tools have been included, as well as the
following specialised tools in the Masterkey Linux distribution:

- **[AIR](air.md)** 1.2.8

Rootkit Hunter is a rootkit scanner.

- **[Scalpel](scalpel.md)** 1.60

definitions and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw
device files.

- **[The Sleuth Kit](the_sleuth_kit.md)** 3.01

command line file and volume system forensic analysis tools.

- **[Stegdetect](stegdetect.md)** 0.6-4

## Forensic Features

- Disk partitions and USB storage devices found by Masterkey are mounted
  read-only automatically. Icons for these mounted devices are displayed
  on the user's Desktop. This facilitates access and prevents a user
  from accidentally writing to the devices and contaminating evidence.

<!-- -->

- Mounting and use of swap partitions is not allowed. This prevents a
  user from destroying any evidence present on swap partitions.

<!-- -->

- Root privilege. The user works with the system as a super user
  (administrator) so that tools requiring root privilege can be used
  straightaway.

<!-- -->

- Console login. The Desktop environment (graphic user interface) does
  not start automatically during bootup. This makes it possible to work
  with Masterkey on older computers. The user can choose to start either
  the KDE or Fluxbox desktops if they wish.

## Forensic Issues

- Masterkey Linux relies on "-o ro" mount option to provide forensically
  sound mounts. Unfortunately, this option is not enough to provide real
  read-only access to media.
