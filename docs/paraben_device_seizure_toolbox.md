The Device Seizure Toolbox was designed as a collection of the items
that would be needed in different scenarios for Device Seizure. The
items in this toolbox in combination with the appropriate software allow
for acquisitions of hundreds of Cell Phones & PDAs. Please note that the

charging tips may support many more models.
