**ESDA** which stands for Electrostatic detection apparatus, is a machine used
within forensics for document examination. The machine allows the visulisation
of indented writing wihout damaging the document.

The questioned document (usually a piece of paper) is put onto the bronze
plate, then a thin film is placed over it. A corona (a highly charged wire) then
passes over the film, giving it an electrostatic charge. The areas in which the
paper is indented will have the greatest charge. Once the corona has passed
over the film, the bronze plate is titled and photocopy toner powder (with
small glass beads) is added. The toner then adds to the areas of greatest
charge, and thus allows the indentation to now be seen.
