libpst is an open source program that can decode the email messages
stored in a [Microsoft Outlook "pst"
file](personal_folder_file_(pab,_pst,_ost).md).

There appear to be two versions of libpst available.

- <http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/> which is actively being developed
- <http://alioth.debian.org/projects/libpst/> which has been last
  updated on July 1, 2008 and won't read the 64-bit PST (Outlook
  2003/2007) format
