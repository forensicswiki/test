[Paraben](paraben.md) **Cell Seizure** is a piece of software
that serves the main purpose of collection and examining data pulled
from various types of [cell phones](cell_phones.md). It is part
of Paraben’s collection of forensics tools.

The main goal of Cell Seizure is to organize and report various types of
files. Following the same guidelines as other Paraben products, Cell
Seizure is able to generate comprehensive [HTML](html.md)
reports of acquired data. Moreover the software is able to retrieve
[deleted files](deleted_files.md) and check for [file
integrity](file_integrity.md).

## Advantages

One important advantage that separates Paraben’s Cell Seizure from other
similar products is the fact that it is designed not to change the data stored
on the [SIM card](sim_cards.md) or cell phone. In other words, all of the data
can be examined while keeping the process undetected. Most commercial or free
software for cell phones is designed do not only view data but to upload data
to cell phones. This is not a safe way to perform a forensic evaluation of cell
phone data. In fact, even some forensic software warns of possible data loss.
Cell Seizure does not allow data to be changed on the phone.

## Disadvantages

A disadvantage of Cell Seizure is that it does not support all makes and
models of cell phones. As with most mobile device forensics software,
Cell Seizure is frequently updated with support for new devices as they
proliferate in the consumer market. However, this application can
acquire information from most models made by the following companies:
[Nokia](nokia.md), LG,
[Samsung](samsung.md), Siemens,
[Motorola](motorola.md),
[Sony-Ericcson](sony-ericcson.md), and can also acquire
[GSM](gsm.md) SIM Cards.

Another disadvantage would be that the format of acquired data can
sometimes be confusing. The data is not organized nice and neat and
given to the user in a way that they can easily understand what they are
seeing. It is not the most user-friendly way of displaying the data that
has been acquired.
