**THE FARMER'S BOOT CD** (**FBCD**) is a [Linux](linux.md) bootable CD
developed by Thomas Rude.

Taking a different approach than other [Live CDs](live_cd.md),
this CD was designed and optimized for previewing systems before
acquiring. It contains a number of programs forensic practitioners can
utilize to preview both [Windows](windows.md) and
[Linux](linux.md) systems in a forensically sound manner.

## Preview Capabilities

THE FARMER'S BOOT CD has been designed for previewing both Windows and
Linux systems. On-site previews before acquisitions is an emerging trend
in the U.S.A. due to legal and technological reasons.

Below is a short list of what can be accomplished in a simple GUI on
this CD;

- Mount file systems read-only, including journalled file system types
- Obtain a list of deleted files for ext2, FAT12/16/32, and NTFS file
  system types
- Undelete deleted files from NTFS file systems
- Obtain both E-mail and URL addresses from the Windows "pagefile.sys"
  file
- Read the Recycle Bin INFO2 records
- Read Windows event log files (AppEvent.Evt, SecEvent.Evt,
  SysEvent.Evt)
- Read many log files from Linux systems (shell histories, system logs,
  security logs, accounting logs, etc.)
- Obtain file system metainformation (creation date, last mount and
  write date, version, label, UUID, etc.)
- Parse Internet cache files from IE, Mozilla, and Opera, pulling
  cookies and histories
- Catalog target file system, selecting files of interest by extension
  or header
- Convert date/time between UNIX 32bit, UNIX hex, human readable,
  Windows 64bit, and Windows hex
- Generate thumbnails for all graphics in fully qualified path filename
- Obtain drive information (serial number, make/model, firmware, HPA
  status, etc.)
- Obtain system BIOS table information (serial numbers, dates, UUIDs,
  etc.)
- Obtain system hardware catalog
- Double-clicking on most common file types opens them (Documents,
  Graphics, Presentations, Movies, Audio, etc.)
