**Multihashing** is the process of using two or more [hashing](hashing.md)
algorithms together. The exact origin of the idea is unknown, but the first
documented use of multihashing was the [National Software Reference
Library](national_software_reference_library.md). The process is now used in a
wide variety of tools, including [hash](hash_(maresware).md) by Mares, fsum,
[hashdeep](hashdeep.md), and fciv.
